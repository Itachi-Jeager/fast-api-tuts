At the same time, oil prices plummeted by 60% following the spread of the global pandemic. As the oil sector accounts for the bulk of Nigerian government revenue, this collapse in prices has profound implications for the economy. The federal government is confronted with the simultaneous challenge of combatting the public health crisis of the pandemic alongside trying to bolster a weakening economy. Given the mounting evidence that the social and economic impacts of these twin crises are likely to be significant, the government is ramping up policy interventions that can help mitigate such negative impacts. Alleviating the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis is vital for preventing poverty from deepening and increasing in Nigeria; before the crisis, approximately 4 in 10 Nigerians were living below the national poverty line, and millions more were living just above the poverty line, making them vulnerable to falling back into poverty when shocks occur. To provide the government with timely evidence to guide the policy response, a new high-frequency survey – the Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (COVID-19 NLPS) – has been initiated in Nigeria. This survey is being implemented by the National Bureau of Statistics with technical support from the World Bank and is designed to measure and monitor the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis by tracking households’ welfare and behavior every month over a period of 12 months. The survey has a panel structure, such that it follows a representative sample of Nigerian households to assess how key indicators that may underpin the overall policy response are changing over time. Household COVID-19 monitoring survey The COVID-19 NLPS collects a wide range of information from households across Nigeria. The sample, which is nationally representative and covers both urban and rural areas, was drawn from the 2018/19 General Household Survey Panel (GHS-Panel), so vital background information on each household was already available. The survey covers important topics including knowledge and concerns about the pandemic, access to food and other basic needs, employment and income loss, and safety nets and coping strategies. Its design is flexible, such that the topics covered can be altered according to evolving needs, priorities, and insights from emerging data. The survey is implemented using the Survey Solutions software for Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing, this allows for faster access to the data and dissemination of results.", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-12-08 10:16:46"}

In this respect, health research ethics is a possible and plausible common ground of exchanging ideas and experiences while building cooperation and partnership. Diseases, infections and health pandemic ravaging the world are heightening the need for good science and medical research with integrity. In protecting research subjects in rural and urban areas from abuses and unwarranted risks, medical research ethics committees are statutorily established across states in the world to regulate the activities of clinical researchers, provide guidance on medical research integrity and facilitate qualitative healthcare delivery. While Nigeria and the Netherlands are not exceptions to the universal ideals of having medical research ethics committees, the histories, circumstances of emergence, configuration and structures, powers, roles and limitations of such committees in the two countries are diverse with some common interesting grounds, worthy of investigation. Currently, there is no study profiling the variations, the extent, the contents and overlaps of the mechanism for research ethics capacity-building in Nigeria and the Netherlands. Nor are there studies interrogating the areas of win-win partnership in research ethics capacity-building and policies between the two countries. Understanding the ambience, contents and mechanisms of capacity-building in research ethics in each of these countries is critical not only to improved bilateral relations and exchanges in medical research and healthcare but also in shaping future directions in the areas of value orientation, curriculum adaptation and health policy regulations. Thus, through philosophical methods of content analysis, critical review of literatures and comparative evaluation, this paper aims to investigate the areas of overlaps, gaps and the strategic lessons that can impact future partnership in ethical biomedical researches in Nigeria and the Netherlands. This paper argues that the efficiency of health research ethics committees is, among other things, a function of the capacity, skills, training, the goodwill of the stakeholders, and the principles underlying research ethics practices. In achieving the UN sustainable health development goals in Nigeria, leveraging on the medical research ethics models, functions, and institutionalization in the Netherlands deserves to be taken seriously. The Netherlands can gain comparative insights from the value placed on the role of culture in minimizing biomedical research misconduct in Nigeria. In both contexts, there are potential models of cooperation that can be calibrated.", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-12-08 10:16:51"}

Although there is no known cure for the virus, scientists are currently investigating the use of chloroquine for the treatment of patients showing mild-to-moderate symptoms of COVID-19. Chloroquine has previously been used for treating malaria in Nigeria but was discontinued. It is currently recognised as appropriate treatment for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It is important to emphasise that investigations regarding its effectiveness in managing COVID- 19 are still ongoing and that there remains no clinically proven and approved cure or vaccine for COVID-19 at this time. Clinical investigations must therefore be conducted in order to ascertain the efficacy and safety of using chloroquine or any other drug to treat COVID-19 By virtue of the provisions of Section 33(6) of the National Health Act, the National Health Research Ethics Committee is charged with the responsibility to develop guidelines for establishing standards to be complied with when conducting research on humans and animals, including clinical trials. Pursuant to these powers, the Committee has formulated the National Code of Health Research Ethics which vests the Committee with the powers to ensure that all research including clinical trials are conducted according to the highest ethical and scientific standard. The National Code of Health Research Ethics provides for the parameters for use of innovative or experimental treatment (see Section B, subsection (f)). The Guidelines also provide for the oversight powers of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) over clinical trials of medicines. In order to ensure that any drug offered to the public as treatment for the virus is safe and effective in reducing the duration of symptoms and combatting the virus, it is necessary for the drug to comply with both the guidelines issued by NAFDAC and the National Code for Health Research Ethics. NHREC therefore calls on Nigerians to desist from stockpiling chloroquine, using the drug without prescription or outside of proper clinical management. Nigerians are also enjoined to treat with care any claims or endorsements on the efficacy of any drugs purported to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19 which have not passed through the necessary processes, including but not limited to clinical trials, and/or received approvals from the relevant statutory agencies. NHREC remains committed to ensuring that all clinical trials conducted in Nigeria adhere to the highest ethical and scientific standard. NHREC therefore calls on all Nigerians to comply with the guidance and advisories from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) and the Federal Ministry of Health. Together, we can beat this pandemic – and we shall.", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-12-08 10:16:58"}
{"link": "https://nhrec.net/clinical-trials/", "title": "Clinical Trials", "body": "A clinical study involves research using human volunteers (also called participants) that is intended to add to medical knowledge. There are two main types of clinical studies: clinical trials and observational studies. NCTR.NHREC.net includes both interventional and observational studies. In a clinical trial (also called an interventional study), participants receive specific interventions according to the research plan or protocol created by the investigators. These interventions may be medical products, such as drugs or devices; procedures; or changes to participants’ behavior, for example, diet. Clinical trials may compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available or to a placebo that contains no active ingredients or to no intervention. Some clinical trials compare interventions that are already available to each other. When a new product or approach is being studied, it is not usually known whether it will be helpful, harmful, or no different than available alternatives (including no intervention). The investigators try to determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention by measuring certain outcomes in the participants. For example, investigators may give a drug or treatment to participants who have high blood pressure to see whether their blood pressure decreases. Clinical trials used in drug development are sometimes described by phase. These are defined by the NAFDAC GCP . In an observational study, investigators assess health outcomes in groups of participants according to a protocol or research plan. Participants may receive interventions, which can include medical products, such as drugs or devices, or procedures as part of their routine medical care, but participants are not assigned to specific interventions by the investigator (as in a clinical trial). For example, investigators may observe a group of older adults to learn more about the effects of different lifestyles on cardiac health. Every clinical study is led by a principal investigator, who is often a medical doctor. Clinical studies also have a research team that may include doctors, nurses, social workers, and other health care professionals. Clinical studies can be sponsored, or funded, by pharmaceutical companies, academic medical centers, voluntary groups, and other organizations, in addition to both local and international Government Agencies. Doctors, health care providers, and other individuals can also sponsor clinical research… Register your Clinical Trials, Search ongoing Trials and Connect with resources, all at the Clinical Trial web portal", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-12-08 10:17:07"}
