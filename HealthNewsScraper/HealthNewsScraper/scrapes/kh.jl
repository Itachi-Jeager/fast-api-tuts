{"link": "https://www.kelinahospital.com/articles/does-increased-psa-mean-prostate-cancer/", "title": "DOES INCREASED PSA MEAN PROSTATE CANCER?", "body": "Prostate Specific Antigen(PSA) is a glycoprotein produced by the prostate gland. Every anatomically normal man has a prostate gland. The prostate gland surrounds the neck of the urinary bladder. The gland produces a liquid juice which mixes with the semen during ejaculation. Semen itself is a creamy secretion that comes out when a man ejaculates, and it is made up of several components which come from the testis, the epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, Cowper’s gland, and the peri-urethral glands of Littre. Sperm cells are only a component of semen. They are not the only component. Some of these components help the sperm cells to survive. Others aid lubrication during coitus. PSA is one of those components. Its physiological function is to aid the liquefaction of semen. When semen comes out initially, it is thick creamy. After a few minutes, it liquefies and becomes as clear as water. Without liquefaction, the sperm cells cannot swim from the vagina of the woman into the Fallopian tubes where fertilization takes place. Some men who are infertile actually produce enough sperm cells, but abnormal liquefaction is the only problem they have. Therefore, the PSA is a vital chemical for reproduction. Normally, only a small portion of PSA filters into the blood circulation. This is the part that is measured when tests are done for PSA. From the foregoing, it is easy to understand that PSA itself in the blood is not a disease, and that normal, healthy men do produce PSA. Therefore, there is no point in attempting to lower the level of PSA for its own sake. Most of it comes out along with semen during ejaculation. But under certain circumstances, a lot more spills into the circulation. It is important to understand that this would cause elevated levels of PSA in the circulation, but that does not necessarily mean prostate cancer. However, the most worrisome reason why PSA in the circulation should be above normal is prostate cancer. In Kelina Hospital, we routinely measure 2 types of PSA: Free PSA and Total PSA. In people with prostate cancer, the cellular membranes and epithelial lining of blood vessels are destroyed by the cancer. This allows a lot of protein from the prostate gland and also a lot of PSA to leak into the circulation. However, a lot of the PSA is complexed with the proteins that equally leak out. Therefore, a lot more PSA is combined than free, in people with prostate cancer. Thus measuring Free PSA compared to Total PSA (which includes the PSA combined to proteins) will give us idea of whether we are dealing with prostate cancer or not. This will help avoid unnecessary biopsies (sampling of the prostate gland with a needle to see if there is cancer in it). Normal, healthy prostate produces more PSA than prostate cancer does. A gland that is enlarged can produce a lot more PSA than smaller glands. The bigger the gland, the more the PSA it produces that spills into the blood stream. If PSA is found to be above normal, the next thing to look at is the size of the gland. The measurement that compares PSA value to size of the prostate is called PSA Density. PSA of 10 in a gland that is, say, 200g, is less frightening than PSA of 3 in a gland that is 30g. Usually, the laboratories would report that PSA values of 1-4ng/ml are normal. These references do not factor in the size of the prostate. Nothing can be farther from the truth than to say PSA of 0-4ng/ml is normal. It all depends on the size of the prostate. That is why PSA values should not be taken on face value. It takes a Urologist to interpret the value. Reference values of 0-4ng/ml are completely useless to an average Urologist. The most worrisome significance of raised PSA is Prostate Cancer. Generally, the higher the PSA, the higher the chance that somebody has prostate cancer. Some cancers do not produce a lot of PSA. Those cancers may be regarded as atypical or anaplastic. Anaplastic cancers are very aggressive. The cells are completely different from normal cells. The more the cancer cells resemble normal cells of that tissue, the less anaplastic they are. The more they resemble normal tissue, the more they behave like normal tissue. Therefore, anaplastic prostate cancers have the least tendency to behave like normal prostate. Sometimes they also do not produce a lot of PSA since PSA is produced by normal prostate cells much more than by cancer cells. In prostate cancer, a lot more of the PSA is combined with proteins, so the ratio of free to total PSA is very low. Patients with urinary tract infection tend to have higher PSA levels than at the time they did not have infection. Most times the levels fall lower after appropriate treatment of the infection. Note that it is wrong to take antibiotics without proper testing of the urine and recommendation by a certified medical personnel. Antibiotics cause a lot of harm to the body’s ability to fight infection on its own. Also, they stimulate bacteria to produce chemicals that can neutralize antibiotics or help the bacteria resist the medications. People who abuse antibiotics tend to develop infections caused by bacteria that turn out to be resistant to most commonly available antibiotics. Simply put, antibiotics breed superbugs! Infection in the prostate is either acute or chronic. Acute prostatitis makes the person very sick, with fever, and a lot of prostration. PSA levels are very high in the blood. Recently, here in Kelina Hospital, we saw a man with PSA of 72ng/ml. It was all because of acute prostatitis. There is a lot of pain around the anus, because the prostate is located just in front of the anus. He could not pass urine. Fever was high grade. After treatment, PSA returned to 2ng/ml within one month. He did not need a biopsy. When patients have any form of surgical procedure on the prostate that does not involve removing the entire prostate gland, PSA levels in the blood rise sharply. This is often seen after a prostate biopsy. PSA rises with age. The rate of rise with age is referred to as PSA velocity. The higher the velocity, the higher the chance there is cancer. But it does rise gradually with age even in those who do not have cancer. After ejaculation, PSA levels the next day tend to be higher. Therefore, it is advisable to abstain from sexual activity at least 24 hours before PSA measurements. There are several machines that measure PSA. Some are not as accurate as others. Here in Kelina, we use a very advanced machine that cost us 20 times higher than previous machines we were using. We switched to this one because of accuracy. Kelina Hospital conducts PSA tests using electro-chemoluminescence technology which is very advanced standard. As part of our contribution to awareness of prostate-related conditions and care, we have conducted free PSA testing for over 500 patients since 2011. These tests are carried out as part of our annual Surgical Outreach Program in which over 30 candidates have also benefited from subsidized prostate surgeries since then. Kelina was the first hospital in West Africa that started doing Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP). Patients can go home the same day, sometimes, after HoLEP. Many of these patients came at a time they could benefit from our annual surgical outreach programme. We are rounding up this year’s programme on September 30, 2020. These are some of the factors responsible for elevation in PSA levels. Before declaring that you have cancer of the prostate, because you have done PSA on your own and the level was said to be high, please see a Urologist for proper assessment.

Suffice to say that it probably was not about surgeries that this idiom was coined. Though originally based on a tailoring metaphor, it bears uncanny similarity to the medical sciences. While most people would rather not have surgery if it is elective, there are occasions where it is better to have a surgery earlier than to put off a procedure. Take a ureteric stone for instance. The stone can completely block the flow of urine and impair Kidney function. The stones originate in the kidney and can easily be diagnosed with medical imaging. Usually, the stones that can enter the ureter are small and often seem to be moving gradually through the urinary tract. The treatment options are to take out the stone, or to allow it continue its progression through the urinary tract, out of the body. If a patient chooses to wait and allow the stone progress naturally through the body, it may or may not pass. In some instances, the ureteric stone gets stuck and can actually make the kidney on that side to shut down completely as it blocks the flow of urine from one kidney. If this happens simultaneously in both sides, the patient would need a dialysis. An impacted stone can cause agonising pain until the kidney completely stops functioning. That is, if the patient waits too long. Medical imaging can reveal that even though the stone is small enough to pass into the ureter, it could be too large to pass through the lower end of ureter by the time it gets there, because this is the narrowest part of the ureter. Once a medical challenge is identified, or some strange pain, swelling or bleeding is noticed anywhere in the body, it is best to see your doctor immediately. Expanding on this, whenever the options are surgery or observation, there are times when the better decision would be to go ahead with the surgical procedure. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule and your doctor would be in a better position to guide regarding this.", "date_published": "Oct", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 14:57:08"}

A patient with urinary retention may be unable to start urination, or if he is able to start, he cannot fully empty his bladder. There is a common misconception that urinary retention only occurs in men. This is not true. Urinary retention is not peculiar to men. It can occur in both genders. The causes of urinary retention could be obstructive or non-obstructive. Obstructive causes include bladder stones, enlarged prostate, prostate cancer, bladder neck stenosis (narrowing), bladder cancer, meatal stenosis, phimosis, paraphimosis, urethral cancerand urethral strictures. These all have the potential to stop the flow of urine. There are several obstructive causes. Non-obstructive causes include bladder atony (loss of bladder tone; flabby bladder) usually due to diabetes, past surgical operations around the bladder with loss of nerve impulses, chronic urinary retention from other causes with damage to the bladder and eventual loss of tone even if the initial cause of retention has been addressed. Nerve problems are also non-obstructive causes, they usually arise from spinal cord compression or injury, as well as autonomic neuropathy (which is how diabetes causes loss of bladder tone). The cause of the obstruction generally determines the mode of treatment. For obstructive causes such as bladder stones or urethral strictures, there are minimal access surgery procedures that could resolve the issue. Often, these procedures could be done without leaving any wound on the body. Non-obstructive causes such as weak bladder muscles can sometimes be treated surgically by reducing the size of the bladder. The symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction from enlarged prostate include: Talk to your doctor about your symptoms and how they affect your daily life. Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on your symptoms. Patients can be classified into those who do not need treatment, those who need medical treatment and those who need surgery. This classification becomes easy once symptom scores are analyzed by aUrologist, and once tests like urine tests, scans and uroflowmetry are done. These are all available in Kelina Hospital. For patients with enlarged prostate, we do both bipolar Transurethral Resection of the Prostate(TURP) and Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate, using the most powerful surgical laser in the world, the 120 Watts Lumenis Laser (Moses Technology). Ours was the first of this laser in the African continent. For stones, we do laser lithotripsy. We have 7 different approaches to stones. All are minimally invasive procedures.

The duration of a surgical procedure largely depends on the type of procedure. Even then, two procedures of the same type can vary in length due to complexity or simplicity of a particular case. Not all surgical procedures take hours. There is this fear some patients have that surgeries are a long, high-stakes affair. This leads to reluctance on their part to consider surgical options to their ailments. While some surgeries can take hours, there are some life-changing surgeries that take less than 5 minutes in the hands of a skilled surgeon. A patient once prolonged a life-changing procedure because he could not make out time for fear he would be admitted in the hospital for a long time. The patient had a urinary retention and stayed away from the hospital until the case was impacting on his quality of life. He kept going from hospital to hospital to see if a catheter could be passed for him so he could go home. He presented to the Urologist screaming out of pain, having gone around for over 24 hours. The Urologist decided not to try to pass a catheter at his point because of trauma already caused in the various places he earlier went to. He chose a suprapubic cystostomy instead. He carried out a supra-pubic catheterization in under 8 minutes and the patient was relieved enough to walk out of the hospital with his own two legs to return later for his review appointment. The review appointment will be to determine how much damage was already caused to his urethra, and to also find out what is responsible for the obstruction to urine flow. Typically, patients with urethral strictures, bladder neck stenosis, or enlarged prostate are admitted in Kelina Hospital after adequate preparation for surgery and they can have their surgeries and go home the same day or latest the next day. People no longer need prolonged hospital admission because of surgery. This is the beauty of Minimally Invasive Surgery.

Wherever the displaced tissue becomes trapped, there is usually a collection of menstrual fluid because there is no outlet for the fluid. It is estimated that one in ten women will experience endometriosis in their reproductive years. The severity of the experience of endometriosis will vary from one woman to the other. The symptoms of endometriosis include painful periods, painful ovulation, pain during or after sexual intercourse, heavy bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, fatigue, and infertility. Endometriosis is commonly found in pelvic structures such as the ovary, uterine ligaments, pelvic peritoneum, cervix, labia, and vagina. However, in some instances, it metastasizes to distant organs like the lungs(thoracic endometriosis) and the brain where it also bleeds concurrently with the normal menstrual flow. If present in the pleural surface of the lung, it will lead to catamenial pneumothorax (blood within the pleural surfaces). This can lead to collapse of the lungs and chronic lung impairment. Should endometriosis occur in the brain,seizures during menstrual periods can occur. This is because the bleed serves as an epileptic focus in the brain.

{"link": "https://www.kelinahospital.com/uncategorized/a-thought-on-breast-cancer/", "title": "A THOUGHT ON BREAST CANCER", "body": "The cells in the body are constantly renewed by the production of new cells and shedding of worn out cells. Some cells die and are digested by the body system. Abnormal cells are quickly removed by the body’s own immune mechanisms. Occasionally, some of the abnormal cells from this regenerative process do not exit the body naturally and can lead to abnormal growth. If these growths are malignant (causing harm to other cells or organs in the body), then they are referred to as cancer. Cancer is a mass of cells whose formation serves no physiologic purpose and whose growth is excessive, and continues in this disproportionate manner and at the expense of normal body cells, even after the initial stimulus for its formation or growth has been withdrawn. Not only do they grow excessively, depleting normal body cells of nutrients, they actually have a tendency to acquire their own blood supply by stimulating formation of new blood vessels. Again, they have ability to jump (metastasize) from one part of the body to another adjoining or distant part, and continue in their uninhibited growth even in that new environment. 7 in 100* Nigerians are likely to die of cancer before the age of 75. The most prevalent form of cancer among Nigerians (regardless of gender), is breast cancer. The most common cancer amongst men is prostate cancer. The key to defeating cancer (of any form) is early detection and treatment. It is recommended that every woman should perform regular breast self examination for early detection of growths in the breast. When a lump is discovered, please seek medical advice from a Surgeon. More often than not, your surgeon would recommend a procedure to excise the growth. It is advisable to have any growth in the breast removed. There is no way to ascertain which lump will turn out to be cancerous while it is still in the body. These days, lumps can be removed with minimal scarring to the breast. Stories abound of women who refuse to undergo surgical procedures because they want to avoid scarring on the breast. Some women do not want to face stigma or be looked upon as different. Society (men and women alike) can help in this regard. If people educate themselves a lot more about the dangers of breast cancer, they are more likely to be empathic towards women who have undergone surgical procedures for breast cancer. Cancer can lead to death. Provide emotional support to women who have undergone or need to undergo surgery for breast cancer  *Global Cancer Observatory Link:  ", "date_published": "Mar", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 14:58:31"}

The World Health organization defines Female Genital Mutilation, colloquially known as FGM: a composition of all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. But in Nigeria, people call it culture and there are four types – Type 1: This is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris). Type 2: This is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without excision of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva). Type 3: This is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris. Type 4: This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, this includes: pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area. But why is such a painful, outdated practice with no scientific basis still practiced in this modern era? It’s a question that baffles even experts as FGM is widespread with no religious affiliation and it’s surprisingly more common amongst the elites. According to the 2013 National Demographic Survey, female circumcision is prevalent among Yoruba women with 55%, followed by Igbo women with 45%. Of all the majority tribes in Nigeria, Yoruba, Hausa, Fulani, Igbo, Ijaw, and Kanuri, only the Fulani do not practice it. Equally, disproportionately higher populations of women who have undergone FGM are in the Southern part of country: Osun has the highest prevalence of circumcised women (76.6%), followed by Ebonyi (74.2%) and Ekiti (72.3%). It’s no better with urbanization: 32% of urban women are circumcised compared to 19.3% of rural women. The explanation seems to be cultural preservation and misinformation. Common misconceptions around FGM are: the presence of the clitoris will result in promiscuity, female sex organs will cause future health problems, female genital mutilation will increase fertility and child survival rate and female genital mutilation will increase male sexual pleasure. This is all false. Women are as capable of staving off their urges as men are and no complications can develop with female natural sex organs as a result of a lack of FGM. The belief that FGM will increase fertility and sexual pleasure is fallacious, it does the exact opposite. Chronic vaginal and pelvic infections can lead to infertility. With type three mutilations, the closing of the vaginal passage can delay progress in the second stage of labour and lead to fetal hypoxia and/or stillbirth. Childbirth trauma – perinea or vaginal tear during delivery, are common with type three and four procedures and could lead to severe infections. Equally, the clitoris’s function other than pleasure is also to stimulate lubrication from glands within the vaginal passage. If the clitoris is damaged or removed, lubrication will be significantly reduced resulting in dryness, painful intercourse for women and reduced sexual pleasure for both parties. FGM is an irreversible, agonizing ordeal with no health benefits and series of complications. Female genital mutilation can kill. Haemorrhage, shock, infection, urinary retention, ulcers, abscesses and scar neuroma are some of the short term effects. While the long term effects include HIV/AIDS, scar neuroma, pain during intercourse, pelvic infection, epidermoid cysts, blood borne viruses and neuromata. The psychological scarring is just as bad as the physical scarring. Victims of FGM can develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), low self-esteem, a psychological denial of sexuality, genital phobia and anxiety and depression. While President Goodluck Jonathan signed a decree to illegalize FGM in 2015, it’s poorly enforced. Amnesty predicting a population explosion in 2030 the numbers of those affected by FGM in Nigeria is expected to remain unchanged. FGM is a cultural disease that has been in Nigeria for centuries, but there are new ways to fight it. NGOs such as The Girl Generation and Born Perfect are spreading information through schools and hospitals on FGM and its effects.  culled from ", "date_published": "Feb", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 14:58:42"}

Regular dental teeth cleaning and polishing is the cornerstone for a lifetime of dental health and the best insurance you can have for keeping a healthy and attractive smile! In order to maintain good oral health, it is vital to visit your dentist every 6 months. Going for your regular check-up helps keep your gums and teeth healthy. It also allows early detection of any problems such as gum disease, dental cavities/tooth decay and oral cancer. To put it simply,it is the removal of plaque and calculus deposits from around your teeth and gums that cannot be removed by brushing. Plaque can be removed by brushing and flossing but some remain behind and harden to form calculus  The structures that hold your teeth firmly to your bone may become affected too and your can lose your teeth. Prophyjet polishing uses a pressurized spray of air and water with sodium hydrogencarbonate powder to remove stains, plaque and soft debris from your teeth. It may taste slightly salty. It is advised that you take your oral health and hygiene seriously as these gum diseases have shown links to other health conditions that can affect your overall health and not just your mouth e.g.", "date_published": "Feb", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 14:58:49"}

Aphthous Ulcer is a common condition characterized by the repeated formation of benign and non-contagious mouth ulcers (aphthae) in otherwise healthy individuals. Recurrent Aphthous stomatitis (RAS)is a common ulcerative inflammatory condition of the oral cavity; it typically starts in childhood or adolescence as small recurrent, painful, round or ovoid ulcers (Aphthous Ulcer) with well-defined erythematous (red) margins, like a halo, and a central yellow or gray floor. The exact cause of Aphthous Ulcers is still unknown; the condition may in fact manifest from a group of disorders of quite different etiologies rather than from a single entity. There is a genetic basis for some Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis. Predisposing factors may include any of the following: Stress Trauma Endocrine (Hormonal) factors in some women Cessation of smoking Allergies to food Hematinic deficiency Immune deficiencies Drugs, especially NSAIDs, Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) a major ingredient in toothpastes  Most patients with RAS are otherwise healthy.RAS has been reported in all races. A slight female predominance exists. RAS normally first arises in childhood or adolescence, predominantly between the ages of 10 and 19 years, with the frequency decreasing in subsequent years. It is interesting to note that the prevalence of presentation has been found to be five times greater in children with high socioeconomic status. The 3 main clinical types of RAS are as follows: RAS ulcers, which can occur in otherwise healthy patients, are relatively small recurrent, round or ovoid ulcers with well-circumscribed erythematous margins presenting like a halo and with a yellow or gray floor. For 2-48 hours before an ulcer develops, RAS is characterized by a prodromal burning sensation. Ulcers commonly present on lining oral mucosa, such as buccal and labial mucosa, and on the tongue, rather than on attached oral mucosa. Hematinic deficiency (e.g., iron, folate, vitamin B-12) Celiac disease Crohn’s disease Neumann bipolar aphthosis Behçet syndrome Sweet syndrome HIV infection, neutropenia, and other immunodeficiencies Periodic fever, Aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) in children. Patient education regarding this condition may facilitate early treatment during prodromal (period between initial symptoms and appearance of ulcer) phases to minimize the discomfort. Children with extensive ulcers should receive proper diet and hydration, as they may avoid food intake as well as hydration. When using palliative measures such as topical numbing medication, the patient must be cautioned against trauma to anesthetized areas while eating or sleeping. The patient should avoid precipitating factors, such as allergens, trauma, and other potential triggers. Patient advice: Avoid Foods that can precipitate the Ulcer. Avoid hot food. Avoid Very Spicy Foods. Avoid eating particularly hard or sharp foods (e.g., toast, potato crisps) and avoid other trauma to the oral mucosa. Identify and correct the predisposing factors for recurrent Aphthous stomatitis RAS. Ensure that patients brush atraumatically (e.g., with a small-headed, soft toothbrush).Patch testing may be indicated to reveal allergies.Analgesics, steroidsand Lignocaine may be beneficial. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouth rinses reduce the severity and pain of ulceration but do not affect the frequency.Medications are available but have unproven efficacy or may have serious adverse effects, because of the systemic effects of those drugs. Minor Aphthous ulcers (MiAUs) are usually self-limiting, with the usual duration being about 10-14 days without any active treatment. Major Aphthous ulcers (MjAUs) can last up to a month. A third type of RAS, the Herpetiform ulcers, is devastating, lasting from 10 days to about 100 days. Ulcers respond well to topical medications, although sometimes a systemic medication may be necessary.", "date_published": "Mar", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 14:58:57"}

Sometimes the hernias are not visible, but examination by a trained hand could pinpoint them. Small hernias can be operated upon as day case surgery (that is, patient could go home same day) under local anaesthesia with no need for patient to be put under general anaesthesia (to sleep). In this short video, the procedure of repair of the defect was performed under local anaesthesia. The mass of fat herniating (causing the discomfort) was protruding through a tiny opening in the patient’s abdominal wall. The size of the protrusion was larger than the opening and hence the pain. The Surgeon excised the protruding flesh, repaired the defect and closed the skin with interrupted stitches instead of stitches that dissolve on their own. This was to ensure that any blood that collects under the skin could find its way out. Surgery was done at 11am and patient left hospital at 2pm. Patients occasionally avoid consulting with a doctor because they have preconceived notions of what their ailment is. Sometimes, patients take their symptoms or even diagnosis from a doctor and do an online search only to arrive at wrong conclusions. Not every pain in the stomach region is an ulcer. Not every persistent diarrhea is dysentery. This patient was on medications for pain and anti-biotics. But infection was not the cause of the problem.

It is the inability of the cervix to carry pregnancy to term. An incompetent cervix can be diagnosed prior or during pregnancy. In pregnancy, the competence of a cervix to carry pregnancy to term is assessed through a stepwise approach which includes maternal history of painless mid-trimester pregnancy loss which is characteristically associated with a decrease in gestational age attained at subsequent pregnancies, mid trimester spontaneous rupture of fetal membranes, history of pelvic procedures like forceful dilatation of cervix during gynaecological procedures, extensive cervical lacerations and so on. The diagnosis is cinched during a pelvic exam which would reveal a short cervix which might have started dilating in early second trimester. Also serial transvaginal ultrasoundscan would reveal a wider endo-cervical canal diameter and short endo-cervical length. These tests are usually carried out during the second trimester of a pregnancy. Your doctor might recommend testing if you have a history of premature deliveries or if your cervix begins to open up early. A patient with an incompetent cervix may not have any symptoms in the early stages of her pregnancy. Frequent antenatal visits can help your doctor monitor your health and your baby’s health. Mention any symptoms that concern you even if they seem silly or unimportant. Some things to look out for include: When a cervix is diagnosed to be incompetent to carry a pregnancy to term, your doctor would recommend cervical cerclage which is a surgical procedure in which the cervix is closed up surgically during the pregnancy. It is an effective treatment for cervical incompetence because it provides the necessary support an incompetent cervix needs to carry a pregnancy to term. The cerclage stitch is usually left in and removed at the 37th week. It can also be removed when the woman’s water breaks or contraction starts. The stitch can be removed in the doctor’s office in a procedure similar to having a pap smear. Cervical cerclage can be the difference for women who have a history of premature births due to cervical incompetence. However, premature births due to infections, preterm labor and other factors cannot be avoided through cervical cerclage.

Suffice to say that it probably was not about surgeries that this idiom was coined. Though originally based on a tailoring metaphor, it bears uncanny similarity to the medical sciences. While most people would rather not have surgery if it is elective, there are occasions where it is better to have a surgery earlier than to put off a procedure. A patient once presented with a ureteric stone that had blocked the flow of urine and was impairing Kidney function. The stone had originated from the kidney and was first diagnosed with medical imaging in another hospital. The stone was a relatively small calculus that seemed to be moving gradually through the urinary tract. The patient had the option to take out the stone or to allow it continue its progression through the urinary tract, out of the body. The patient chose to wait and allow the stone progress naturally through the body. Fast forward to a few months later, the patient presented at Kelina Hospital with impaired kidney function and a ureteric stone that had effectively blocked the flow of urine from one kidney. If this happens simultaneously in both sides, patient would need a dialysis. It was clear that the patient had been managing the progress of the stone with a doctor. But this did not stop the stone from getting impacted. He had waited too long in the hopes that the discomfort he was feeling was due to the passage of the stone. However, the stone was not moving. Medical imaging revealed that even though the stone was small enough to pass through the ureter, it was too large to pass through the lower end of ureter by the time it got there. This is the narrowest part of the tube. Once a medical challenge is identified, its best managed with the help of your doctor. Expanding on this, whenever the options are surgery or observation, there are times when the better decision would be to go ahead with the procedure. There are, of course, exceptions to every rule and your doctor would be in a better position to guide regarding this.", "date_published": "Jun", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 14:59:26"}
{"link": "https://www.kelinahospital.com/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-ectopic-pregnancy/", "title": "What You Need to Know About Ectopic Pregnancy", "body": "Ectopic pregnancy is defined as pregnancy that implants outside of the lining of the womb. It could be located in the fallopian tube, ovary, abdomen, or cervix. However, tubal pregnancy accounts for 97.7% of cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 585,000 women die every year as a result of complications related to pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery period. This is higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Ectopic pregnancies are responsible for 10% of maternal mortality (pregnancy related death) in the first trimester (3 months) of pregnancy.The rate (risk) of ectopic pregnancy increases with age regardless of race and is highest for women between the age of 35 and  44.  These are factors that predispose a woman to having Ectopic pregnancy, the commonest being Pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine abnormalities, previous tubal pregnancy, illegal abortion,previous tubal surgery, certain contraceptive failures like IUD. Other rare risk factors include cigarette smoking, ovulation induction and transmigration of the ovum as it passes down the fallopian tube. In about one-fourth of tubal pregnancies, the corpus luteum, which is where the ovum came from that resulted in the pregnancy, is found on the other ovary, not on the same side as that of ectopic pregnancy.  There must be a high index of suspicion, as clinical presentation or symptoms may differ depending on the location of the ectopic pregnancy. Also symptoms may mimic other clinical entities like spontaneous miscarriage. Due to the fact that symptoms differ, based on the location of the ectopic pregnancy, Doctors are always extra careful before concluding that the symptoms a patient presents with are suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. Most women with ectopic pregnancy will have a missed period, spotting par vagina with associated abdominal cramps or lower abdominal pain. In cases of tubal rupture patient can present in shock with marked lower abdominal pain.  Advancement in clinical technology during the past 20 years has resulted in earlier diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. The availability of a highly specific immunoassay for hCG and high-resolution ultrasonography has resulted in the ability to diagnose ectopic pregnancy in its earliest stages. Pregnancy can now be diagnosed from the 25th day of the menstrual cycle (this is before a missed period). Other diagnostic measures used previously include: culdocentensis; serum progesterone; Dilatation and Curretage.  All these have their limitations.  This is typically divided into three broad umbrella groups which include: expectant management, medical management and surgical management. Some patients with ectopic pregnancy undergo spontaneous absorption and require no therapy. Hence, expectant management entails watchful waiting in patients with an un-ruptured tubal ectopic, with a clinical suspicion that ectopic gestation may be dying off.  These patients are admitted in the hospital from the time of diagnosis to complete resolution of ectopic. This entails repeated tests, serial Beta hCG level assay and scans (Transvaginal Ultrasound Scan). This is to ensure the pregnancy is not thriving, instead of resolving, otherwise it will eventually rupture. At present, it is considered better to remove an un-ruptured ectopic pregnancy at the time of first laparoscopy (Diagnostic Key Hole or Minimal Access Surgery) to avoid the additional expense of hospitalization, serial hCG assays, and a second surgery later. . This may also play a role in carefully selected patients. It entails the injection of medical substances like methotrexate, urea or high concentration of dextrose into the gestational sac to cause death of the embryo. These groups of patients are also closely monitored with serial Beta hCG assay and Transvaginal scan. However, there may be recourse to surgery if the embryo persists. Surgery can be conservative (laparoscopy) or open surgery. Conservative surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy is well established, and laparoscopic salpingostomy is the preferred operative method in un-ruptured cases. This is available in Kelina Hospital. This has the advantage of cosmesis i.e no big scars on the abdomen, short hospital stay with lower risk of intra-operative adhesions, faster recuperation and earlier return to work. This is desirable to most patients especially single ladies who prefer their abdomen to remain unscarred. The type of surgery performed also depends on the extent of affectation of the tube or location of the ectopic in question. Open surgery is advocated in the face of tubal rupture and overt hemorrhage, salpingectomy (removal of the tube) may be necessary to provide rapid treatment and to prevent serious morbidity and mortality.

In spite of this, like all gradual processes, tooth decay (also called dental caries or cavities) does occur, often unnoticed, and can also happen instantaneously and/or go unnoticed for a while, especially at initial stages. This fact makes it necessary to gain more knowledge on the topic of tooth decay: its causes, progression, complications, treatment options, and ways of preventing it. is the hard, white outer part of the tooth. is the layer below the enamel. It is a hard tissue that contains microscopic tubes. When the enamel is damaged, heat or cold can enter the tooth through these paths and cause sensitivity to pain. is the softer, living, inner structure through which nerves and blood vessels run. When tooth decay is at the beginning stages, no symptoms might be present at all. As the decay progresses, the following signs and symptoms will begin to be present: Despite popular stories, tooth decay is not caused by worms eating away the surface of the tooth, but rather by one eating a lot of sugary and  starchy foods and failure to clean one’s teeth well.When sugars and starch remain on the tooth, certain bacteria present in the mouth quickly begin to feed on them and form a substance known as dental plaque, a clear sticky acid-containing film that coats the tooth. If this plaque remains on the tooth, it can harden into ‘tartar’ or ‘calculus’ which is more difficult to remove and thus creates a shield for bacteria. The acids in plaque remove the minerals in the enamel (the tooth’s hard outer covering). This removal of minerals leads to formation of holes in the enamel (this is the first stage of cavities). Once the enamel has been affected, the acids and bacteria can make their way to the next layer, the dentine. The dentine is much softer than enamel and not as resistant to attacks. The dentine also has tiny tubes that communicate directly with the tooth nerve. Therefore, when acids and bacteria attack the dentine, sensitivity occurs as tooth decay progresses, the bacteria and acids continueto eat through the layers of the tooth, eventually reaching the pulp cavity – which contains blood vessels and nerves. The pulp cavity becomes swollen and irritated, resulting in a lot of pain and discomfort. The discomfort could extend outside of the tooth to the gum, and even to the jawbone. Tooth decay and cavities are often ignored or go unnoticed. If they are not treated properly, several complications could arise, among which are: In severe cases, the person suffering from tooth decay could have loss of appetite, severe weight loss and tooth loss.These complications could interfere with daily living, affectself-esteem and the ability to carry out tasks normally and effectively. Treatment of Tooth Decay depends on severity. It is important to visit the dentist at least twice a year (every 6 months) for check-up and examination, even when you don’t feel any pain. The dentist can identify tooth decay through an oral examination or an X-ray. Treatment options for Tooth Decay include: Tooth decay is a common dental problem. However, it is possible to prevent it by doing the following: Eat teeth-healthy foods. Certain foods and beverages are healthier for the teeth than others. Avoid foods that can get stuck in grooves and pits of the teeth for long periods of time, or brush soon after eating them. Fruits such as fresh fruits and vegetables, on the contrary, increase salivation. Unsweetened coffee, tea and sugar-free chewing gum help to wash away food particles.

In Kelina Hospital, we have been doing bipolar TURP since 2011. TURP is better than open surgery because there is less bleeding and there is no wound on the body after surgery. Patients go home earlier. Bipolar TURP is better and safer than monopolar because there is less bleeding and also little chance of TURP syndrome. TURP also takes out bigger glands. Kelina Hospital has 2 machines for bipolar TURP, Autocon II and Autocon III. Our Autocon III was the first in Africa when we bought it.

This is an obstetric emergency (if nothing is done it can be life-threatening), and accounts for about 25 – 40% of deaths in women following delivery (maternal mortality) worldwide. This figure is higher in Africa due to lack of adequate health coverage for all women especially for women who live in the rural areas and hinterlands. This bleeding is defined as loss of more than 500mls of blood post vaginal delivery or more than a liter following cesarean section. It is also defined as any blood loss severe enough to lead to hemodynamic instability(instability in the blood circulatory system, with resultant clinical sequelae, such as drastic fall in blood pressure, dizziness, collapse, or even shock)in a woman who just had a delivery. There are 2 types of PPH: primary and secondary. occurs within the first 24 hours following delivery. This is usually life threatening because it is caused by factors associated with delivery. Other causes include disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, uterine rupture and uterine inversion. usually occurs after the first 24 hours and up to 6 weeks post-delivery. This is usually due to infection, commonly caused by retained products of conception. Management of PPH depends on the cause, some of which have been discussed in this article. Excessive blood loss can either be managed in the labour room, if mild, or in the theatre, if severe.If there is uterine atony, administration of oxytocic medication, rubbing off contractions, emptying the urinary bladder will help stop bleeding. Patient may need blood transfusion depending on severity of bleeding. If these measures fail more drastic measures can be undertaken by the Obstetrician. In the event that the placenta or membrane is retained, the doctor will attempt to remove it under anesthesia in the theatre. If perineal laceration is the cause of the bleed, your Obstetrician will look for where this is and repair it to stop the bleeding. The important thing to note is to attend antenatal care in a hospital where you can easily access your Obstetrician with good blood banking or laboratory services like in the advent of an emergency like post partum hemorrhage.

An enlarged prostate blocks the flow of urine which could cause infection and even kidney failure. Most men as they approach the age of 60 will begin to show signs of a condition called Benign Prostate Hyperplasia. Some can actually have symptoms before the age of 50. Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), is a major cause of urinary obstruction amongst males in Nigeria. BPH is an ordinary enlargement that is not due to cancer but is obstructing the urine flow nonetheless. Even though BPH is more common in males above the age of 60, it is advised that men above the age of 40 have annual prostate exam. This is because the symptoms of BPH are often very mild at first, but they become more serious if they aren’t treated. Some common symptoms include: • Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying • Nocturia, (which is the need to urinate two or more times per night) • Dribbling at the end of your urinary stream • Incontinence, or leakage of urine • The need to strain when urinating • A weak urinary stream • A sudden urge to urinate, which you cannot postpone even in an inappropriate environment • A slowed or delayed urinary stream • Painful urination • Blood in the urine Whenever an adult male shows any of the above symptoms, they are strongly advised to visit a Urologist for a routine check. BPH if discovered early can be managed and even treated as an outpatient issue.", "date_published": "Jan", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:00:20"}

I looked at all the people and grumbled2 to myself. I would be in here forever and I just had so much to do. Chirsmas was beginning to 70-486 Exam become CIPTV1 300-070 dumps such a drag. I kinda wished that I could just 70-486 Exam sleep through Chirsmas. But I hurried the best I could through all the people to Prepexamwell the toy department. Prepexamwell Once again I kind of mumbled3 to myself at the prices 70-486 Exam of all 210-065 civnd dumps these toys, and 300-208 sisas dumps wondered 1Z0-144 practice test if the grandkids would even play whit4 them. I found myself in the doll aisle5. Out of 300-208 sisas dumps the corner of my eye I saw a 1K0-001 exam questions little boy about 5 holding a lovely doll.He kept touching6 her 1K0-001 exam questions hair and 70-486 Exam he held her 1Z0-144 practice test so 70-486 Exam gently. I could not 1K0-001 exam questions seem to help myself. 1Z0-144 practice test I just kept loking over at the little boy and wondered who the 1Z0-144 practice test doll was for. I watched him turn to 1Z0-144 practice test a woman and he called his aunt by name and said, “Are you sure Prepexamwell I don’t have enough money?” She replied a bit impatiently, “You Prepexamwell know that you don’t have enough CIPTV1 300-070 dumps money for it.” The aunt told the little boy not to go anywhere that she 1K0-001 exam questions had to go and get some other 1Z0-144 practice test 1K0-001 exam questions things and 210-065 civnd dumps would be back in a few minutes. And then she left the aisle. The boy continued to hold the doll. After a bit I Prepexamwell asked the boy who the 70-486 Exam doll was for. He said, CIPTV1 300-070 dumps “It is the doll my 300-208 sisas dumps sister wanted so badly for Chirsmas. She just knew 210-065 civnd dumps that Santa would bring 1Z0-144 practice test it. “I told him that maybe Santa CIPTV1 300-070 dumps was going to bring it . He said, “No, Santa can’t go where my sister is….

My Daddy says that Mamma is going to have to go be with her.” 1Z0-144 practice test 210-065 civnd dumps My heart 1K0-001 exam questions nearly stopped beating. Then the boy looked at me again and said, “I told my 1K0-001 exam questions 70-486 Exam Daddy to tell my Mama not to 70-486 Exam go yet. I told him to tell her to wait till I got back from the store.” Then he asked Prepexamwell me if i wanted to see his CIPTV1 300-070 dumps picture. Prepexamwell I told him I’d Prepexamwell love to. He Prepexamwell pulled out some picture he’d had taken at the front of the store. He said, “I want my Mama to take this with her so the dosen’t ever forget me. I love my 1K0-001 exam questions 300-208 sisas dumps Mama so very much and I wish she dind not have to leave me.But Daddy says 70-486 Exam she will need to be with 70-486 Exam my sister.” I saw CIPTV1 300-070 dumps that 210-065 civnd dumps the little boy had 300-208 sisas dumps lowered 1K0-001 exam questions his head and 210-065 civnd dumps had grown 300-208 sisas dumps so 210-065 civnd dumps qiuet.

I Prepexamwell asked the little boy, “Shall we 300-208 sisas dumps count 70-486 Exam that miney one more time?” He grew excited and said, “Yes,I just 1Z0-144 practice test know CIPTV1 300-070 dumps it has Prepexamwell to be Prepexamwell enough.” 300-208 sisas dumps So I slipped 300-208 sisas dumps my money in with his and we began to count 1Z0-144 practice test it . Of course it 1Z0-144 practice test was plenty for the doll. He softly said, “Thank you 1K0-001 exam questions Jesus for giving me enough money.” Then the boy said, “I just 210-065 civnd dumps 1K0-001 exam questions asked Jesus to give me enough money to buy this doll so Mama can take it with her to 210-065 civnd dumps give my sister. And he heard my prayer. I wanted to ask him give for enough to 210-065 civnd dumps buy my Mama a white Prepexamwell rose, but I didn’t ask him, but 300-208 sisas dumps he gave me enough to Prepexamwell buy 70-486 Exam the doll 210-065 civnd dumps and a rose for my Mama. She loves white CIPTV1 300-070 dumps rose so much. “In a few minutes the aunt came back and I 1Z0-144 practice test wheeled my cart away. I could not keep from thinking about the little boy as I finished my shoppong in 70-486 Exam a ttally different spirit than when 300-208 sisas dumps I 300-208 sisas dumps had CIPTV1 300-070 dumps started. And I kept remembering a story I had seen CIPTV1 300-070 dumps in the newspaper several days earlier about a drunk driver hitting a car and killing7 a 1Z0-144 practice test little girl and the Mother was in serious condition. The CIPTV1 300-070 dumps family 210-065 civnd dumps was deciding on whether to remove the 1Z0-144 practice test life support. Now surely this little boy CIPTV1 300-070 dumps did CIPTV1 300-070 dumps not belong Prepexamwell with that story.Two days CIPTV1 300-070 dumps later I read in the paper where the family had disconnected the life 1K0-001 exam questions support and the young woman 210-065 civnd dumps 210-065 civnd dumps had died. I could not forget the little boy and just kept wondering if the two were somehow connected. Later that day, I could not help myself and I went out and bought aome white roses and took them to the funeral home where the 70-486 Exam yough woman was .And there she was holding a lovely white rose, the beautiful doll, and the picture of the little boy in the store. I left there in tears, thier life changed forever. The love that little boy had for his little sisiter and his mother was overwhel. And in a split8 second a drunk driver had ripped9 the life of that little boy to pieces. We have seen many young men in Kelina Hospital who have lost their testis as a result of torsion. In some cases, both testes are lost, and they can never possibly have any child in their lives. This happens because they were presented to the wrong hospital or chose to buy medicines on their own without knowing what is responsible for their problems. Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood supply to the testis. A young man was presented in our hospital complaining of pain in the right scrotum which started while he was doing early morning exercise. According to his family, he noticed the pain and swelling of his testis after jogging that morning and notified his parents and he was rushed straight to the hospital. The Urologist examined him and booked him for emergency surgery. In this young man’s case, we can say that he is very lucky to have been rushed straight to the hospital to see a specialist. We have seen similar cases where by the time the patients were brought to see a specialist, the testis was already black and dead. Pain and swelling of the scrotal sac are usually the main symptoms of testicular torsion. Most people, in general, do not understand the difference between testicular torsion and infection, and when they have pain, they assume it is due to infection and they start themselves on analgesics and antibiotics. Torsion could occur while people are asleep. Torsion tends to occur early in the morning when testosterone levels are at their peak, and the cremasteric reflex is strongest. Occasionally, a tumor or prior trauma may be present and risk factor includes a congenital malformation known as a “bell-clapper deformity” wherein the testis is attached to the epididymis vertically instead of longitudinally allowing it to move freely and thus potentially twist. Cold temperatures may also be a risk factor. Torsion of the testes is a medical emergency, but many adolescent males are hesitant to say they are having pains on their testes or seek treatment right away. You should never ignore sharp testicular pain. It’s possible for some men to experience what is known as intermittent torsion. This causes a man to have a testicle twist and untwist. Due to the fact that the condition is likely to recur, it is important to seek treatment, even if the pain becomes sharp and then subsides. Surgical repair is usually required to treat testicular torsion. Surgery is performed as quickly as possible to restore blood flow to the testicles. If blood flow is cut off for more than six hours, the testis would turn black and die. The affected testicle would then need to be removed. Even if it is not removed, it will gradually reduce in size until it disappears. Surgical detorsion is performed under anesthesia. Your doctor will make a small incision on your scrotum and untwist the cord. Tiny sutures will be used to keep the testicle in place in the scrotum. This prevents rotation from occurring again. The surgeon then closes the incision with stitches. Most men treated for testicular torsion within six hours of the onset of pain don’t ultimately require removal of the testis. However, the majority of men do require surgical removal of the testis if treatment is delivered late after the pain starts. Removal of a testis (orchidectomy) can affect hormone production in infants. If your body begins to make anti-sperm antibodies because of torsion, this can also lower sperm motility even if the other testis is healthy and continues to produce normal sperm cells. Surgery is always done on both sides because the other side will equally undergo torsion one day. In another case, a young University Student who had pain in the scrotum presented at our hospital. The mother took him to a family doctor who was not a specialist. He did not recognize that this was torsion. He placed the patient on antibiotic medicines for pain. Three months later, the testis started going down in size until it disappeared completely. The next year, he had a similar experience in the remaining tests. The mother took him to the same hospital and the same treatment was repeated. Two weeks later, they decided to see a Urologist, who informed them that this was torsion. He was later taken to the theatre. But the testis was black and dead. Both testes were gone and therefore he will never have children all his life. This was the story of another young University Student from Cyprus. He went to a hospital in Cyprus when the pain started. Unfortunately, the doctors over there did not recognize this problem either. One month later, he had pain in the other testis. This equally was not recognized as torsion. He lost both testes. He currently has symptoms of low testosterone, such as loss of libido, energy, and erection. He will never have children. You should seek emergency medical attention if you suspect that you or your children are experiencing testicular torsion to avoid these possible complications. Surgery is a highly effective treatment for testicular torsion if the condition is caught early.", "date_published": "Jan", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:00:31"}

During this period, surgeries are usually done at a reduced price, under sponsorship of Surgical Aid Foundation. This year’s theme was Laparoscopic Surgery. The programme took place between 5th-16th June 2017 and only patients who were qualified for laparoscopic procedures were taken. We had a case of patient with pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction to the kidney who had advanced surgical technique of Laparoscopy Pyeloplasty. It would appear that this was the first of such procedures to be done in this country. It involves the deployment of three small access points on the skin and the patient was up on his feet the same day of surgery and ready to go home the next day. Several other procedures were done, including Laparoscopic Biopsy of a retroperitoneal mass causing retroperitoneal fibrosis, Laparoscopic marsupialization of a deep-seated kidney cyst, amongst others. Kelina Hospital is a centre of excellence for Urology, and it is no wonder that mostly urological procedures were done in the first week of this programme. Nigerians often troop abroad on medical tourism to have very simple surgeries done at a very high cost whilst the same procedures are available at home with little stress and lower budget.  Kelina hospital has been reputed to have high-tech surgical equipment for endoscopic, lithotripsy, laser-based and laparoscopic surgeries and citizens could reduce expenses on their health by taking advantage of what is available here at home. One major advantage of taking treatment at home is that almost everyone requires follow-up care, especially after surgery. When people go out of the country, often without referrals, and return to meet doctors here in the country who did not participate in their care abroad, it is pretty difficult to know where to start or continue from. The patients have a lot of difficulty travelling out for every little headache thereafter. When surgery is done at home, patients could go back to the hospital time and again. Sometimes consultation fees are waived when patients need to see doctors frequently. This is impossible if you do your surgery abroad. Once in a while, some procedures are not available in the country. Most Surgeons know the best of their colleagues to handle such cases abroad and it is always best to let a Nigerian Surgeon in that specialty recommend to you whom to see abroad. Referrals to specialists abroad should not be from non-specialists in Nigeria. Any doctor who is not a specialist in a particular field cannot say for sure that a specific procedure outside his field is not available here at home. Our candid advice to any patient is to always meet the specialist before travelling abroad, rather than going to the web to locate doctors abroad for themselves. This could be a tragic mistake that may land you in a lot of trouble. We have seen Nigerians with minor health challenges going abroad and coming back in coffins.", "date_published": "Feb", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:00:37"}

LAPAROSCOPIC PYELOPLASTY. Pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction -or uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction- is something that people are born with. The junction between kidney and the ureter(the small tube that carries urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder) is very tight, if not completely blocked, because the anatomy is not well developed while the baby is forming in the womb. Sometimes there is a blood vessel that crosses this point and causes obstruction to the urine flow. The kidney in PUJ obstruction is ballooned out, a condition called hydronephrosis. Urine cannot pass. Gradually, the kidney loses function. If it happens in both sides, the person can actually go into kidney failure. In many countries, diagnosis can be made before the child is born and surgery can be done while the child is in the womb, even if it is just to pass a stent, a small tube, to allow the urine to pass into the bladder of the child. If this does not happen, the child makes less and less urine and amniotic fluid volumes are depleted. Without amniotic fluid, the child cannot float freely. Very tight space within the womb would not allow the child develop normally. This condition is called oligohydramnios. It causes several other problems for the unborn child. So it is very important for the unborn child to make a lot of urine within the womb, because this forms the bulk of the amniotic fluid. Congenital PUJ obstruction also damages the kidneys even before the child is born. The kidney material would be compressed and fail to develop normally. When the condition is mild, the child can be born normally and can even grow into adulthood. But there tends to be a lot of pain in the flanks, the area where the kidney is located. The kidney affected is also hydronephrotic. Without repair, the damage to the kidney is irreversible. Kidneys that are obstructed tend to form stones. They also get infected easily and subject to recurrent urinary tract infection. A distended, obstructed kidney is very painful. Traditionally, repair has always been through open surgery. To the best of our knowledge, open surgery is what is practiced in Nigeria. In , on December 5, 2017, we did our first laparoscopic repair of PUJ obstruction. It is called laparoscopic pyeloplasty. The advantage of laparoscopic surgery is that there is minimal or no scar on the skin. For a girl especially, having a tummy free of scars is very important. Other advantages of laparoscopic or Minimal Access Surgery are: • There is little or no blood loss • There is less Pain • The patient can return to work early • It allows easy repeatability • The Surgeon has better vision • There are less complications e.g. adhesions, injury to neighboring organs. • There is less transfusion rate with its associated problems e.g. infection • The patient has a higher quality of life after surgery. Our patient was a 30-year old lady who did not want a scar. She also did not have enough funds to travel abroad where laparoscopic or robotic surgery is commonly done. Dr Undie, our Urologist, has had a lot of training in laparoscopic surgery. He also has Fellowship in this area. He led a team of doctors and nurses that was able to successfully carry out laparoscopic pyeloplasty yesterday. Surgery lasted 3 hours. Patient is doing fine and will go home later this week, without a scar on her tummy or need for blood transfusion.", "date_published": "Feb", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:00:50"}

Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is one of the five types of viral hepatitis. The others are hepatitis A, C, D & E. However, hepatitis B and C are the ones most likely to become chronic if not properly treated. Hepatitis B is highly contagious, it spreads through contact with infected blood and other bodily fluids. Some poor social habits and other possible ways of contracting HBV includes:          Transmission of the virus may also occur particularly in unvaccinated men who had sex with men and heterosexual persons with multiple sex partners or contact with sex workers. Infection in adulthood leads to chronic hepatitis in some cases. Sometimes people who have HBV may not know and symptoms may not appear until during the acute infection stage. The incubation period of hepatitis B virus is 75 days on coverage, but can vary from 30 to 180 days. The virus can be detected within 30 to 60 days after infection. Some of the symptoms associated with HBV include yellowish eyes, dark urine, loss of appetite, mild fever, clay-colored stool, easy tiredness. TREATMENT: There is no specific treatment, cure, or medication for an acute HBV infection, supportive care will depend on the symptoms. PREVENTION: A vaccine against HBV has been available since 1982.This is a series of three injections, The CDC recommends that all children receive a birth dose of HBV vaccine and complete the series by 6 to 18 months of age. Individuals who must also receive the vaccine include all health workers, individuals with multiple sex partners, dialysis patients, and recipients of solid organ transplant. It is best for everyone to be vaccinated against HBV infection. The complete vaccine series induces protective antibody levels in over 95% of people vaccinated. Hepatitis B test is done in Laboratory using Chemo-illuminiscence technology with an expensive machine called Cobas. This method is far more reliable than dipsticks which are commonly used everywhere. There is a vaccine against HBV infection which is available in our pharmacy. Recently, we had one patient who tested negative with Test Strip but positive when we used our new machine. Hepatitis B is more infectious, more deadly and perhaps more prevalent than HIV, but funnily, people are more scared of HIV than HBV. Fortunately, it is preventable through vaccination.

{"link": "https://www.kelinahospital.com/articles/enlarged-prostate-symptoms-diagnosis-and-treatment-in-kelina/", "title": "Enlarged Prostate, Symptoms, Diagnosis And Treatment Options In Kelina Hospital.", "body": "Everyone reading this post right now is either a man with a prostate gland, or has a father or brother with a prostate gland. Therefore, the prostate is an important organ everybody needs to know something about. Prostate cancer, for instance, is the commonest cancer affecting black men the world over. We will talk about that at some other time. The Prostate gland is a male sex organ, and is shaped like the green almond fruit. Imagine a tube running through the centre of the fruit from up to down. That is the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder to the outside. In practice, the prostate lies at the neck of the urinary bladder, and surrounds the beginning of the urethra. It is about 8cm deep from the skin behind the scrotum. It is just in front of the rectum, so a finger inserted into the rectum can actually touch it. This is how Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) is done by the Urologist to feel the consistency and size of the prostate. It feels firm in consistency like hard muscle. It feels very hard like bone and nodular when it is cancerous. The prostate weighs about 20g. When enlarged, it could actually become as big as a small tangerine, guava or actually as big as an orange fruit. We once removed a prostate in Kelina Hospital that weighed 720g.  The prostate contains glands, which produce some of the liquid that mixes with semen during ejaculation(most of that liquid comes from the seminal vesicles). It also contains fibrous tissue, like the type of tissue you find attaching muscle to bones, which is whitish in colour and very hard. Finally, the prostate contains some smooth muscle. Smooth muscle also tends to be whitish in colour, like the muscle you find in the stomach or intestine of animals, as distinct from skeletal muscle, which is reddish, found in the laps, back and shoulders. The proportion of these 3 components, namely, smooth muscle, glands, and fibrous tissue (collagen) varies from one individual to another, and these proportions determine how big the gland can get before it begins to obstruct the urine flow. Glands that are made up predominantly of glands and smooth muscle tend to be very huge, yet urine could still pass. Glands that are made up mostly of collagen tend to block urine even when the prostate is not bigger than normal size. It is easy to see, from the above, that the degree to which the prostate can disturb urine is not entirely due to the size of the gland. Some people would request for medications that could “shrink” the prostate. Those medications work mostly on glandular component. Therefore, prostates that are small and obstructing (that is, prostates that are made up predominantly of fibrous tissue) do not respond well to these medications. Second, those medications have a lot of side effects, because they work mostly on glands, by blocking the hormones that stimulate those glands. Therefore, they could interfere with erection and also interfere with production of PSA, which equally comes from those glands. When PSA production is disturbed, the level of PSA you see when you measure it is no more reliable. People who are on these medications could, therefore, develop prostate cancer without knowing this, because the common screening test for cancer, PSA, is no more reliable.  Finally, people who are on these medications tend to present with prostate cancer that is already advanced. Such medications should never be used for more than 3 to 6 months. Common problems that could affect the prostate are cancer, ordinary enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) that is not due to cancer but is obstructing the urine flow nonetheless, and infection in the prostate, called prostatitis. There are several other problems that could show up in the prostate, but these 3 are the commonest. When the prostate begins to disturb urine flow, there are often symptoms or signs to the patient. Some people do not have symptoms. They just notice one day that they could no longer pass urine. Others even develop kidney failure without knowing that the prostate is responsible. Some also develop cancer in the prostate without a single symptom. The severity of the symptoms does not depend on the size of the prostate. Small prostates that are fibrous, as we saw above, can actually cause more trouble, sometimes, than huge glands.  Therefore, treatment does not depend on the size of the prostate. It depends on the severity of the symptoms or the damage caused by the obstruction. Some of these symptoms are actually not due to obstruction. Some are due to irritation of the nerves around the prostate, that also supply the inside of the bladder, or to the pressure the enlarging prostate is exerting on the neck of the bladder, which tends to carry most of the weight of the urine inside the bladder. When there is a lot of urine in the bladder, this part of the bladder detects the weight of the urine and sends a signal that the bladder is full. However, when this part is irritated by anything, whether it is weight of the urine, inflammation, nervous stimuli or the prostate pushing into it, there is a tendency to feel as though the bladder is full, even when it is empty. The individual then feels like passing urine every time. All the symptoms associated with urine are called Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms include the following:  These symptoms are called voiding symptoms, because they are noticed when you are trying to void. Others are called storage symptoms, because they are noticed when you try to hold the urine back. There is a problem storing the urine for a long time. They include the following:  There are other symptoms that do not strictly fall into the above categories. They include:  Prostate symptoms are not common in men who are less than 45 years of age. Most men who have prostate problems are up to 50 years or older. However, those who have a family history of prostate problems could have symptoms at an earlier age. Women, although they do not have prostate glands, can also have LUTS. In fact, some studies show that both women and men have similar LUTS, age for age. This is made by listening to the symptoms, examining the patient generally and even doing a DRE, and proving that the symptoms are not due to other problems, several of which also produce similar symptoms. Things that are done to confirm the diagnosis are: THINGS THAT COULD MIMIC PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT. The doctor tries to prove to himself that the problem is due to the prostate, before commencing treatment. There are so many things that the Urologist would do to satisfy himself that he is dealing with an enlarged prostate. OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT There are 3 main groups of medications:  Catheters are either made of silicone, which the body does not react to much, or latex rubber. Latex catheters are very cheap, but they also cause a lot of reaction around the urethra, and this could predispose to very early infection. Silicone catheters are better, but they are very expensive. Not all individuals are suitable for medical treatment. In fact, if an individual really needs surgery and is placed on medical treatment or opts for medical treatment instead, his condition may deteriorate. People on medical treatment need to see their Urologist frequently, to ensure that their condition is not deteriorating. Surgery is a more serious form of treatment but has the best chance of long term relief. Medical treatment is forever. Surgery is usually a one off treatment. REASONS FOR PROSTATE SURGERY Surgery could become necessary under the following circumstances or to avoid the following problems:  In , 85% of all urological surgeries, from the kidney down to the meatus where urine comes out, are done without the surgical scalpel or knife (without cutting the body open). The following Surgical Options for the prostate are available in Kelina Hospital:  There are several other techniques done in several parts of the world. In 2017, Kelina Hospital will also start Holmium laser enucleation(HoLEP) as well as laser vaporization. In HoLEP, The prostate tissue is removed enbloc and pushed into the bladder. It is then removed with a moselator. The Gynaecologists already do moselation for uterine fibroids here in Kelina Hospital, because most of their fibroids are done laparoscopically. They use the moselator to bring out the growths. FOLLOW UP All patients who have had prostate surgery in Kelina Hospital are advised to see the Urologist at least once every year. Removing the prostate does not stop an individual from developing prostate cancer. This is because the capsule, which surrounds the adenoma, or the inside of the prostate to be removed, is like the shell of an orange fruit and is left behind when the inside is removed. This shell equally contains prostate cells, and these cells can also undergo a cancerous transformation. The Urologist would definitely want to keep an eye on the prostate to ensure that if it becomes cancerous, the cancer could be detected early, at which time it could still be curable.", "date_published": "Feb", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:01:01"}

SAF is partnering with Kelina Hospital, Gwarinpa, Abuja this October 2018 to bring hi-tech surgeries to our people. By hi-tech surgeries, we mean expensive surgeries that require a lot of technology, which are not commonly available to the general public in this country, such as endoscopic surgery, laparoscopic surgery and laser-based surgery. The rich can travel to any country in the world to have Minimal Access Surgery performed on them. Those who are not so rich are left with us. They equally need help. SAF will be underwriting some of the bills to make it possible for patients to have these surgeries done in Kelina Hospital between October and November 2018. Kelina Hospital does all these procedures. Kelina was the first hospital in Nigeria to install a laser machine for lithotripsy for kidney stones. SAF has partnered with Kelina Hospital since 2011. Fifty eight (58) surgical patients have benefitted from SAF support since 2011, costing SAF N39,600,000. In 2018, SAF will be sponsoring Minimal Access Surgery for the following problems: • Enlarged Prostate. HoLEP (Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate) will be done using 120 Watts Laser, the latest technology recently acquired by Kelina Hospital. This is the first of this type of laser in Africa. HoLEP was never done in Nigeria before 2018. Only TURP was available for prostate surgery. TURP has so many limitations compared to HoLEP. • Kidney stones. Laser Lithotripsy will be done through flexible uretero-renoscopy. • Huge Kidney Stones. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) will be done along with Lithotripsy using the Swiss Lithoclast Master. • Gall Stones. Laparoscopic Surgery will be done for gall stones. • Gynaecological Problems, including uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts. Laparoscopic Surgery will be done on selected patients. • Other forms of Minimal Access Surgery will be considered on a case-by-case basis. No open surgery will be done in the course of this programme. Only patients who apply and meet the requirements will be done. We have received over 70 applications from patients this year, who wish to benefit from this programme. In the past, we have focused on breast cancer and cancer of the cervix. Cancer of the cervix is the most common cancer affecting women in Africa. Early detection is the only way to possible curative treatment. Early detection is possible using the PAP smear. We sponsored 200 patients that responded to our invitation for free PAP smear in 2014, costing SAF N3m. This year, SAF will be focusing on Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer is very prevalent in our society. Black people have the highest incidence of prostate cancer in the whole world. Some of our patients with prostate cancer have not been regular with their Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) checks. PSA is used to monitor response to treatment. SAF has decided to invite those who would benefit from these tests to come over this October for PSA test free of charge. The test will be quantitative, and so will give us exact level of the PSA. Our current technology can measure PSA levels accurately from any level, even as low as 0.0001 to as high as 5,000. Over 200 patients have indicated interest. SAF will be spending over N3,000,000.00 on PSA tests on individuals, especially the financially challenged, who come to us this October. The 3rd aspect of the Outreach Programme this year is free dental checks. So far, over 300 people have registered to have a dental check and have been booked for the clinic examination. SAF will be spending over N900,000 on these checks in 2018. The programme will climax with a Public lecture at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre, to be delivered by a friend of Kelina Hospital, Prof. Kenneth Ife as the guest speaker and Dr Theophilus Ndubuaku as the Keynote speaker. The special guest of honour will be the Honourable Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac F. Adewole. The programme will be chaired by Prof O. O. Mbonu, an eminent Urologist and former President of the West African College of Surgeons. Professor Okey Mbonu was once the Chairman of the Board, UNTH, Enugu, and also former Chief Medical Director, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital. We want to use this opportunity to invite the general public to this lecture on November 8, 2018 at 2.00pm. The 2018 programme will end with the commissioning of the new 120 Watts Holmium laser, recently acquired in Kelina Hospital, by the Honourable Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac F. Adewole also at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre on November 8, 2018. Patients interested in any of the listed surgeries or some other form of Minimal Access or laser-based surgery in Urology, General Surgery or Obstetrics and Gyneacology should send an email to or to register.

{"link": "https://www.kelinahospital.com/articles/prostate-cancer/", "title": "Prostate Cancer", "body": "The prostate gland is a walnut-shaped organ with two lobes which lies just below the bladder, surrounding the urethra. The size of the prostate varies with age. In younger men, it is about the size of an almond fruit, but it can be as large as a tangerine or even a big orange fruit in older men. It produces seminal fluid, which nourishes sperm cells and it helps to direct semen outwards during ejaculation. Prostate Cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate gland. Cancer begins when cells in a part of the body start to grow out of control. Cancer cells can move from one part of the body to another part, and continue to grow in the new location even at the expense of normal cells in that organ. At the moment prostate cancer is the most-commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second most common cause of cancer death in males worldwide. It is the number one cancer killer of Nigerian men with a mortality rate of over 80%. A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that within a period of 4 years, deaths from prostate cancer in Nigeria increased by almost 100 per cent. The report showed that Prostate cancer now kills 26 Nigerian men every day (up from 14 men every day). Like many other malignancies, the specific cause of prostate cancer is not known. There are, however, risk factors that may predispose one to having the disease. Such risk factors can be classified as modifiable or non modifiable. Non- modifiable risk factors are those which the individual has no control over. These include Race, Age and genetic/familial predisposition. The chance of having prostate cancer rises rapidly after age 50. We have diagnosed prostate cancer in Keina Hospital in men as young as 45. Having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles one’s risk. Men with several affected relatives have a much higher risk, particularly if their relatives were young at the time the cancer was found. Prostate cancer occurs more often in Africans. It also occurs at an earlier age in blacks and has a more aggressive course. The modifiable risk factors include: Diet, Obesity, Smoking, Workplace exposures Men who eat a lot of red meat or high-fat dairy products appear to have a slightly higher chance of getting prostate cancer. Men who are obese (very overweight) have a higher risk of getting more aggressive prostate cancer. smoking has been linked to a possible increase in the risk having prostate cancer. People who handle chemicals are generally at more risk for cancer than the general population. A man could have prostate cancer without having any symptoms at all. This is what is seen in many cases. It may present with features of lower urinary tract obstruction such as straining to urinate, waiting for a while before urine starts coming out, poor urine stream, bloody urine,sudden stopping and starting of the urine stream even when the bladder is not empty, urinary frequency, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, incontinence, terminal dribbling, urinary retention and kidney failure. The above symptoms are also similar to symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), which is non-cancerous. Patients may also present with waist pain, shortness of blood and breathlessness. There could be weight loss, poor appetite, weakness or numbness in the lower limbs. These other symptoms are more commonly found in those with prostate cancer. Physical examination alone cannot reliably differentiate benign prostatic disease from cancer. Blood levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Ultrasound Scan of the Prostate along with Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) of the prostate can help in differentiating. Consequently, a biopsy is warranted to establish a diagnosis. If cancer is suspected, determining whether the disease is localized or extends outside the prostate is important for planning treatment. Currently, the majority of prostate cancers are identified in patients who are asymptomatic. Diagnosis in such cases is based on abnormalities in a screening PSA level or findings on DRE. In addition, prostate cancer can be an incidental pathologic finding when tissue is removed during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) as a means to manage obstructive symptoms from BPH. Kelina Hospital has equipment for Bipolar TURP as well as Transurethral Vaporization of the Prostate, as well as Laser Vaporization. Factors considered in the treatment of prostate cancer include the age of the patient, the extent of the disease as well as the degree of aggressiveness of the cancer. For localized prostate cancer, active surveillance, watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy, are options. If there is obstruction of urine flow, TURP is also an option. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound(HIFU) treatment also gives good results in small prostates. For locally advanced prostate cancer, radiation therapy along with androgen ablation is generally recommended. Metastatic prostate cancer is rarely curable. Management of these cases typically involves therapy directed at the relief of particular symptoms (e.g.palliation of pain) and attempts to slow further progression of disease with androgen blockade and anti-cancer chemotherapy. Surgical treatment currently includes laparoscopic procedures, robotically-assisted procedures and the open radical prostatectomy. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer is also known as Androgen Deprivation therapy (ADT). It may consist of surgical castration (orchidectomy) or medical castration, using medications like antiandrogens and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Testosterone, a hormone produced by the testis, stimulates growth of prostate cancer. By removing the testis or using medicines that either bind to testosterone receptors to block the effect of testosterone or medications that block the production of this hormone, prostate cancer cells cannot thrive. If detected early, prostate cancer is curable. Locally advanced or metastatic disease is more recalcitrant.", "date_published": "Feb", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:01:47"}

This is heralded by presumptive signs in the first trimester and fetal kicks in second trimester which the mother learns to associate with a sense of well being of the developing baby inside her. Movements are first perceived by the mother between 18 and 20 weeks of gestation, which is termed “quickening,” often described as a gentle flutter and rapidly acquires a regular pattern. Fetal movements have been defined as any discrete kick, flutter, swish or roll made by the baby. Such fetal activity provides an indication of the integrity of the central nervous and musculoskeletal systems. The normal fetus is active and capable of physical movement and goes through periods of both rest and sleep. A significant reduction or sudden alteration in fetal movement is a potentially important clinical sign which could be a sign of impending fetal death. At least 40% of pregnant women become concerned about reduced fetal movement (RFM) one or more times during pregnancy. Most cases are transient.  However, the type of fetal movement may change as pregnancy advances in the third trimester. By term, an average of 31 movements is felt per hour (range 16–45), with the longest period between movements ranging from 50 to 75 minutes. Fetal movements show diurnal changes. The afternoon and evening are periods of peak activity. Fetal movements are usually absent during fetal ‘sleep cycles’. These occur regularly throughout the day and night and usually last for 20–40 minutes per time. These sleep cycles rarely exceed 90 minutes in the normal healthy fetus.  Fetal activity is influenced by a wide variety of factors. There is some evidence that women perceive most fetal movements when lying down, fewer when sitting and fewest while standing. It is therefore not surprising that pregnant women who are busy and not concentrating on fetal activity often report a misperception of a reduction of fetal movements. An anteriorly positioned placenta prior to 28weeks of gestation may decrease a woman’s perception of fetal movements. Sedating drugs which cross the placenta such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, methadone and other opioids can have a transient effect on fetal movements. Also cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in fetal activity. Fetuses with major malformations are more likely to demonstrate reduced fetal activity.  First thing, is to lie down on your side and observe the baby’s kick for 2 hours. If you have at least 10 kicks, the baby is okay for at least 24 hours. However, if the feeling of Reduced Fetal Movement persists kindly seek medical care in a facility where you can access an obstetrician. Please don’t sleep it through the night; or postpone your visit your little one may be in danger. 1. Reduced Fetal Movements. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 57. February 2011 2. Eldam S, Jessen P.

There are several health conditions that in times past would make surgery difficult or impossible.They include stroke, hypertension and diabetes. Patients would be denied surgical solutions to their medical challenges because they were diabetic or hypertensive, especially where these conditions were uncontrolled. Patients who had suffered a stroke needed to wait for several months before surgery. Operating on a diabetic for removal of kidney stones used to be a very complicated procedure. If stones were in both sides, one side would be done first, and the patient would return to the hospital 6 weeks later for the other side to be done. Admission in the hospital was prolonged. The major complication with diabetic patients is that their blood sugar could swing too high or too low while they are under anaesthesia, and the usual symptoms they feel with either situation can no longer be felt while they are completely under anaesthesia. This swing is difficult to control even if the patient’s blood sugar is being monitored every hour. Minimal Access Surgery was recently performed at Kelina Hospital on a middle aged patient who had hypertension and diabetes at the same time. He did not have to be off his drugs or convert to insulin. Patient had stones in the left and right kidney. Laser lithotripsy was performed to remove the stones in both kidneys in one day, and the patient was ready to be discharged the next. There is minimal to no blood loss in an endoscopic surgery, even if patient is on blood thinners like aspirin. Patient can return to his normal meals immediately after the surgery. In Kelina Hospital we do most procedures endoscopically. Even patients in heart failure, with a cardiac pacemaker, and those who have had a recent stroke have all been successfully done. Minimal Access Surgery is available for many surgical procedures. It is important that awareness of this option is made available to the general public. It is even more important for those that have long term or chronic illnesses.", "date_published": "Jun", "date_scraped": "2021-12-15 15:01:55"}

The longer a person delays their visit to the doctor, the higher their risk of complications. While visiting the doctor can be scary because of the unknown, knowledge of your general health condition is way better. Early detection of ailments saves lives. This is as true for infectious diseases as it is for malignancy or organ failure. We have seen patients that have been saved by early detection and have also had the occasion of patients losing organs due to delays in seeking medical attention. A patient once decided to come home from abroad to have his surgery in Kelina Hospital. He had been nursing discomfort in his mid section for a prolonged period, and after visiting a doctor, it was discovered he had a non-functional kidney. He elected to come back to Nigeria and have his surgery done in Kelina Hospital because he had heard stories of foreign nationals being treated shabbily when they chose to access healthcare in countries where they live, especially where no one understands their language. A CT IVU showed that the patient’s left kidney was not functional. Fluoroscopy and endoscopy revealed the patient had been nursing a PUJ obstruction since birth. The kidney had become a bag of water. More than one litre of urine was drained from theaffected kidney and a stent was introduced to support kidney function. Distended renal pelvis was filled with up to 2 litres of urine and the kidney had become flabby, like a half-empty polythene bag of water. In the end, it became impossible to save the kidney, and the patient had to lose what may have been an otherwise functional kidney. Leaving a bad kidney in place could damage the remaining kidney that is still functioning well. In practice, one kidney is enough to sustain life.This patient may have been saved by an earlier diagnoses. Do not neglect your health for any reason.

This study sought to determine the chemical composition of urinary stones seen in Abuja, Nigeria. This was a retrospective study on composition of uroliths. Urinary stones surgically removed from 155 patients through minimal access surgical procedures between January 2015 and August 2019 were analysed. Optical crystallography and infrared spectroscopy were used to determine the chemical composition of the urinary stones. A total of 155 urinary stones were assembled from the patients. More stones were removed from male patients and the male to female ratio was 1.9:1. Stones were rare in the extremes of age. The predominant location (89.7%) of stones was in the upper urinary tract. All stones were of mixed composition with calcium oxalate accounting for 93.55%. Calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate and uric acid stones were more common in the upper tract, while 2 of the 3 struvite stones were found in the lower tract. Stones found in this study were of mixed composition with the most common constituent being Calcium oxalate and the least common, struvite. Uroliths, Analysis, Composition.
