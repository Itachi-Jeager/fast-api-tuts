At the Press Conference to Update Nigerians on The Status of Covid-19 Vaccination on 1st June 2021", "body": "I will begin with an update on our vaccination efforts. As of today, 1,956,598 of targeted eligible Nigerians have been vaccinated with their first dose of the Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine. Of this number, 66% are frontline workers, 22% are healthcare workers, while 12% belong to the elderly group. Furthermore, 73,465 Nigerians have also received their 2nd dose across 36 states and the FCT. This includes His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who both received their second doses on Saturday, May 29. Similarly, you would have seen that in many States, the Governors, members of the legislature, traditional and religious leaders have publicly started taking the second dose of their vaccinations. Only yesterday, members of the Presidential Steering Committee including myself received our second doses of the vaccine. I can assure that we are all doing well. Indeed, on my part, the side effects following the second dose was much less that the first dose. We continue to advise that all Nigerians who have received their first dose should check their vaccination cards for the date of their second dose, and proceed to the same health facility where they got their first jab, to ensure full protection against COVID-19. Our health teams are working hard, and I’d like to thank them once again for all their efforts to make sure Nigerians are being vaccinated. I’d also like to thank the Nigerian public for your cooperation and support in achieving a smooth vaccination campaign. This has been a national effort that involves all stakeholders. There have been cases of mild, moderate and severe Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) since we officially rolled out Covid-19 vaccination on March 15, 2021. The AEFIs symptoms ranged from pain and swelling at site of vaccination to more serious symptoms such as headaches, abdominal pain, fever, dizziness and allergic reactions. A total of 10,027 cases of mild AEFI have been reported as of May 30 , while 86 cases of moderate to severe incidents have been reported. All these individuals have since fully recovered. Five States have the highest records of AEFI namely: Cross River (1,040), Kaduna (1,071), Lagos (796), Yobe (555), and Kebbi with 525 cases. We acknowledge the possibility of some people relocating from the States where they took their first doses. For this reason, we have made provision for special vaccination sites that could accommodate administering their second doses. It is also possible that due to certain circumstances, some of the sites used for the first dose vaccination may no longer be available; in this case, you are kindly advised to go for your second dose at the nearest vaccination post. The list of the vaccination sites is available on our website (www.nphcda.gov.ng), which we will keep updating and will also be published accordingly. Please bear with us while we try to make the vaccination process as seamless as possible. On the global vaccine supply and anticipated next consignment, the Covax facility has communicated that the upcoming allocation is likely from July-September 2021. The exact dates are still being finalized. Nevertheless, bilateral conversations are ongoing to see how we can access the surplus vaccines being stockpiled by developed countries. On this, we are working closely with the Embassies and High Commissions in Nigeria. Our communication remains clear that the allocation of vaccines from friendly countries is most useful now, not later when vaccines become widely available. While we are pushing for equity, justice and fair play in the global allocation of vaccines, the Federal Ministry of health is working with critical stakeholders to fast track the establishment of local vaccine production plants in Nigeria. This initiative will be seizing on the environment created by the lopsided availability of vaccines, momentum around intellectual property waivers and health security imperatives that vaccines represent. I would like to mention that GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance through UNICEF and in partnership with NCDC and NPHCDA have donated $8M worth of PPE to be used by primary health care workers across all 36 States and the FCT. These PPEs are already on their way to the sub-national level, courtesy of Unicef. We thank our partners and value their continued partnership in supporting our frontline health workers. Finally, I want to encourage all Nigerians to remain vigilant. Each and every one of us must follow social distancing, mask wearing, and curfew guidelines. Significant concern remains about the threat posed by the Coronavirus B.1.617.2 variant, also known as the Indian variant, which is observed to be a highly contagious triple-mutant strain of the coronavirus. In England, cases of the variant have doubled in one week alone. It is very important that we take all the necessary precautions set out by the Government to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak here in Nigeria. Vaccination remains the safest and most effective public health intervention known to man. Throughout history, vaccines have saved millions of lives. The Federal Government under the leadership of His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari is determined to overcome the supply challenges the world is currently experiencing and ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are accessible free of charge, to all eligible population in Nigeria. All of us, working together, can help keep Nigeria safe. Ensuring that we take both doses of our Covid-19 jab is a significant step in this collective effort. This is our priority at PSC, FMOH and NPHCDA. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless Nigeria. ED/CEO", "date_published": "06, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 11:29:31"}

At the Press Conference to Update Nigerians on The Status of Covid-19 Vaccination on 25th May 2021", "body": "We are very pleased to announce today that we have almost completed administering all first doses included in this campaign, as of 24 May. We have now provided the first COVID-19 vaccine doses to a total number of 1,929,237 Nigerians, representing 96% of the targeted population. In addition, we have begun providing second doses, and that number has reached 4,683. Those individuals currently eligible for second doses will have received their first dose 6 to 12 weeks ago. We are advising that all Nigerians who have received their first dose should check their vaccination cards for the date of their second dose, and ensure that they receive the second dose to gain full protection against COVID-19. As we transition to administering second doses, our teams have assessed the communication and mobilization activities that have been undertaken thus far to create awareness for the COVID-19 vaccine and encourage uptake. We will be building on the work we’ve already done in these areas to ensure that Nigerians can easily access accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination. Our goal is to do everything possible to educate, combat misinformation, and ensure confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and to ensure all Nigerians have clear information on how, where, and when to get the vaccine. We will do this through continuous engagement and communication with communities across our country. Permit me to say that the success we have achieved with the first dose is the collective efforts of all stakeholders, for which we are most grateful. In particular, I want to use this opportunity to sincerely appreciate the father of the nation His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, for his exemplary leadership and for providing all the needed resources to enable us successfully conduct this unprecedented massive vaccination.  We also wish to appreciate the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 response under the leadership of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha for his guidance. Our partners and donors have been with us providing technical support and resources. They are represented here by the WHO and UNICEF Country Representatives Dr Walter Mulombo and Peter Hawkins respectively. We thank you so much. As most people here know by now, the global community is facing great challenges regarding vaccine supply. Like most nations, this impacts the clarity over Nigeria’s next shipment. While we have information that we may get the next consignment of vaccines by end of July or August, these have not been officially confirmed. When we are able to, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of the next shipment. At present, we do not have that information available due to the wider context we are in. However, we can update you on some positive developments. Pfizer and BioNTech pledged on Friday of last week to provide 1 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine to low-and-middle-income countries by the end of 2021, and another 1 billion doses in 2022. Johnson & Johnson also announced it has signed a deal to provide 200 million doses of its vaccine to Covax. Separately, the International Monetary Fund is now advocating for a $50 billion fund to be spent on ensuring a faster rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and is calling for at least 40% of the global population to be vaccinated by the end of this year, and at least 60% by June 2022. The fund would be used to increase COVAX vaccine coverage, procure additional tests, and expand vaccine production capacity. We strongly endorse the creation of such a fund and emphasize that all nations must have comparable access to COVID-19 vaccines in order to end this pandemic. Additionally, the United States announced it will donate 20 million vaccine doses by the end of June to the COVAX scheme. At this juncture, I will like to provide an update on the rescheduled dates for the PSC’s Zonal Town Hall meetings across the remaining Zones. Please mark your calendars. I will conclude by noting that the Federal Government is taking significant precautions to protect Nigerians against B.1.617.2, known as the Indian variant.  Flights from India and other high-risk countries such as Turkey and Brazil have been barred from entering Nigeria, we are ramping up our test and trace measures, and we are accelerating the national project to establish production of oxygen supplies across all states of Nigeria. I want to seize the opportunity to enjoin Nigerians to continue to observe the Public Health or non-pharmaceutical measures in place to curb the transmission of Covid-19, as we are not out of the woods yet. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and update citizens. Now, we will turn it over to questions. Thank you for listening. God bless you, and God bless Nigeria.

In the last few weeks, we focused our attention largely on creating awareness around second dose and reopening of first dose administration along with vaccine rationalization in the states. This was to ensure that those who received their first dose of the vaccine go out and get their second dose for maximum protection. In the same vein, eligible people who are yet to be vaccinated at all, have the opportunity to receive their first dose. You may recall that a total of 4,024,000 doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine were received by the Federal Government of Nigeria in March 2021; 924 million through the COVAX facility and another 100,000 doses from the Government of India. I am glad to inform you that 3,441,146 doses have so far been utilized for the 1 and 2 dose vaccinations, which is approximately 88% of the total AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine stock in the country. As at today, the breakdown of the number of people vaccinated and the vaccine consumption is as follows: Based on these data and comparative information from other countries, Nigeria continues to have the highest vaccination rates in Africa with approximately 87,000 people being vaccinated daily. Egypt, South Africa, Ghana and Senegal each have a daily vaccination rates of 72,000, 52,600, 12,100 and 4,790 respectively. It is pertinent to note that as of today, there is no vaccine with the expiration date of June 28th that has not been utilized, which means that there is currently zero balance of such vaccines in the country. Again, this is to demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that only safe and potent COVID-19 vaccines are administered to Nigerians. Although, we have had reported cases of mild, moderate and severe reactions since our COVID-19 vaccination roll out in March 2021. 125 Severe AEFI cases were reported while 13,663 mild to moderate cases were reported. These are often expected reactions from normal vaccination and people who experienced any of these have recovered fully and are doing well. More pleasing to mention is that with over 3million people vaccinated, Nigeria has not recorded any death case directly linked with Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI). For clarity, the World Health Organization (WHO) has described the term Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) As you may be aware, we are working closely with NAFDAC and NCDC to determine whether such medical incidences are connected to the vaccination. There is also the MED-SAFETY App which is available free for download on Play store for Android devices and Apple Store for IOS devices, whereby people can report vaccine side effects for themselves or on behalf of others and will receive timely response. While we are vigilant that no expired vaccines are used in Nigeria, we advise all eligible people (18 years and above) to take advantage of the opportunity offered in the reopening of first dose administration so that they get vaccinated against COVID-19. We are equally calling on those who received their first dose not later than May 17 and are yet to take their second dose to make themselves available for their second dose in order to be fully protected against the disease. Please note that this vaccination phase will close on the 5 of July, 2021 and people are requested to go for their vaccination between now and July 5 . Furthermore, provision has been made for people who may have taken their first dose of the vaccine outside the country and want to take the second dose back home. They can go to any designated health facility nearest to them to receive their jab, as we have informed our Health workers not to turn them back. As part of the global effort to rapidly halt the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, the United States of America has outlined strategies to increase global supplies of COVID-19 vaccines. These allocations will be made through platforms such as the COVAX facility and the G7+ platform, of which Nigeria will be a beneficiary. On Friday June 25th, after a two-day board meeting, the board of the GAVI vaccine alliance stated that it has approved a further $775 million to fund the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income economies over the next two years, as it plans to accelerate the rollout. GAVI’s board also set new terms for accessing vaccines, which will disincentivise middle-income nations from participating by insisting they pay for COVAX vaccines fully in advance next year. Starting in 2022, the model will enable self-financing participants that rely on the facility to access doses to continue procuring vaccines through COVAX under revised terms and conditions. The changes mean countries in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as the likes of South Africa, could face higher costs to access the scheme and would need to borrow money to secure doses. However, the poorest countries, mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia, will keep the same conditions, with little or no costs to buy vaccines. The Federal Government has also recently received communication from the COVAX facility for additional allocation of 3,924,000 doses of AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccine, which according to the supply forecast, will be available for delivery into the country by July/August 2021. Similarly, the government is procuring a total allocation of 29,850,000 of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine through the African Union Commission and the AfreximBank arrangement. This is expected by September 2021. We have been informed that some people have the fear of potential side effect and are therefore hesitant to take the vaccine. In some instances, even those who have taken their first jab are afraid of taking the second jab because of side effects. Let me again assure everyone that reactions are expected from all types of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccine is therefore not an exception. What is important is for us to understand that the vaccine is safe and effective and that the reaction would not last, as it only relatively indicates in the individuals that the vaccine is working. So please, think of the long term benefits of getting vaccinated against COVID-19, than the brief reaction you may experience after taking the vaccine. Our strategic leaders have continued to receive their 2nd doses publicly to motivate people. I would like to use this opportunity to appreciate them and all our other stakeholders who have continued to lend their voices in combating the misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. These include other government organizations such as the NCDC and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) that galvanized the Telecommunication companies to support our sensitization campaign through their SMS broadcast. So also the various media outfits that have been airing our jingles and sensitizing the public about the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nigeria. A few weeks ago, I reported that under the leadership of the Hon Ministers of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire and Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Eminent Nigerians led by the Deputy Secretary General of the UN, Dr Amina J Mohammed, have been working with local entities such as NAFDAC, NIPRD, NIMR and biovaccines to strengthen the ecosystem and capabilities for local vaccine production. We thank these individuals for their patriotism, dedication and selflessness Likewise, the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) has indicated its support by incorporating the NPHCDA’s slogan of as part of their third quarterly meeting theme which is scheduled for August in Jos, Plateau State. Further details of this engagement will be provided in due course. Distinguished members of the press, let me at this juncture remind you that our North-West zonal town hall meeting is coming up in Kano on Thursday 1 July, 2021. You are cordially invited and we are counting on your usual cooperation to make it successful. Please let us all continue to wear our face masks and observe the other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Thank you for listening. Stay safe and remain blessed.", "date_published": "06, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 11:29:31"}

At the Press Conference to Update Nigerians on The Status of Covid-19 Vaccination on 24th June 2021", "body": "Let me start by thanking you all for your steadfastness in promoting the health and well-being of Nigerians, particularly as it relates to the ongoing vaccination against COVID-19 and Government’s efforts to facilitate recovery from the adversities the disease has introduced to our lives. Similarly, I would like to appreciate our dedicated teams and the health care workers all across the country for their incredible work in the COVID-19 vaccination implementation. I am deeply convinced that your collective determination is based on sheer patriotism towards advancing the quality of health care in all parts of the country. We will continue to pray and work hard, and hope that sooner than expected, Nigeria and the world will be able to put COVID-19 behind and forge ahead with our new normal way of living. The Federal Government has remained committed to ensuring that every eligible person in Nigeria is vaccinated against COVID-19. As of today, June 24 2021, our data shows that 2,099,568 people have been vaccinated with their first doses while 1,005,234 have received their second doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. You would recall that the government reopened administration of first dose to address increase in vaccine demand by people who were yet to be vaccinated at all. This resulted in the increase in number of clients vaccinated with the first doses. Let me further clarify that full vaccination DOES NOT exempt people who have received their second doses of the vaccine from observing the infection prevention and control measures. It is very important for everyone, including those who have received their second doses to continue to wear face masks and observe other non-pharmaceutical measures to prevent the spread of the virus. We understand the constraints of time arising from our various economic and social engagements and because of that, we decided to extend the administration of second dose of the vaccine until 5 of July 2021. You would recall that the initial closing date for second dose administration was 25 of June, 2021. Even though we have extended the timeline for the second dose administration until 5 of July 2021, however those who have received their first dose no later than May 13 are advised to visit the nearest vaccination site to receive their second dose as soon as possible, for full protection against COVID-19. Furthermore, we continue to receive requests from Nigerans who have taken the first dose of the vaccine outside the Country but want to take the second dose back home. They should walk into the nearest designated health facility to receive the jab. Health workers are hereby requested not to turn them back. Our decision to reopen administration of first dose is indeed a great opportunity for those who are yet to be vaccinated. Please let us take advantage of this opportunity to get ourselves, our families and communities protected by going to get your jabs and kindly encourage others who are 18 years and above to do so as well. This set of people should be rest assured that by the time they are due for their second doses, we would have received another consignment of the vaccines. We have experienced great frustration regarding the global vaccine supply. Not only have there been huge challenges with respect to vaccine manufacturers producing enough vaccines for the world, but there also has been great inequity in terms of distribution. Most countries of the world have received few, and in some cases no, vaccines. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently and we are communicating this very clearly to our international partners on behalf of Nigerians. Recently, we are encouraged by the swell of contributions and pledges from major nations into COVAX. Rich nations of the world are showing greatly increased recognition that there must be more supply produced and it must be distributed much more fairly, and they are becoming active in solving this. Just a few days ago, the U.S. White House reconfirmed it will send an initial 80 million doses internationally by the end of this month, with additional shipments continuing to ramp up thereafter. These supplies and other large donations of vaccines to COVAX that are now planned will enable COVAX to supply new consignments to Nigeria and other nations who need vaccines now. As I mentioned the last time, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) is working closely with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) response. An App known as MED-SAFETY App was launched; it is available for free on Play store for Android devices and Apple Store for IOS devices. With this App, any individual can report vaccine side effect for him or herself, or on behalf of another person, and will receive timely response. There are also other pharmacovigilance measures in place to monitor and respond to AEFI cases throughout the country. So far after more than three million vaccinations, 13,267 people have experienced mild side effects, while 4,708 have experienced moderate to severe side effects. It is however important for me to repeat that Nigeria has not recorded any case of death directly linked to COVID-19 vaccination. Cases of mild, moderate and severe reactions that have been recorded are expected from normal vaccination, and people who experienced any of these have since recovered and are doing well. Therefore, we should not allow the fear of side effects to discourage us from taking the vaccine, as the long term benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risk of brief side effects. In continuation of our sensitization efforts, I would like to inform you that the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC) under the able leadership of Barrister Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, will continue to engage with stakeholders and our communities through the Zonal Town Hall Meetings. Accordingly, the next meeting will be the North-West Zonal meeting to hold in Kano state. And from Kano, we will be continuing to other geopolitical zones of the country where we are yet to have the meetings. I am counting on your resilience to continue to be part of this historic effort. It is worthy to mention that our commitment to discuss our vaccination efforts directly with the communities is hinged on the principles of transparency and inclusiveness in the interventions to protect the lives of Nigerians against COVID-19. Our experiences in North-Central and North-East have been highly encouraging and assuring of our collective will to overcome COVID-19 and put it behind us, the way we did to the Wild Polio Viruses (WPV). We therefore remain optimistic that through Town Hall Meetings and other awareness creation events, we will be able to safeguard our communities against COVID-19. I wish to again reassure Nigerians that the Federal Government under the leadership of His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari is highly concerned about the safety and health of its citizens and is committed to interrupt COVID-19 transmission through vaccination and non-pharmaceutical measures. We must therefore do our part to keep ourselves and our communities safe. Please stay safe! Thank you most sincerely for your attention. God bless you and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria!", "date_published": "06, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 11:29:33"}

Executive Director/CEO, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib made this known during the weekly press briefing to update Nigerians on COVID-19 vaccination. It would be recalled that earlier, the UK government had donated 699,760 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Nigeria, thus bringing the total of donations to the country by the UK to 1,292,640 doses. According to the ED said, “The additional doses would be included in the 2nd dose vaccination exercise currently ongoing for clients who have already taken the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the 1st phase.” He called on those who have received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine before 8th July 2021 to go and get their second dose to be fully protected against all strains of the Coronavirus. Dr. Faisal also charged state governors to intensify mobilization of their citizens to prioritize the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in their respective states, adding that vaccines are potent tools in mitigating the outbreak of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. While appealing to journalists to dedicate more contents and programmes to address misinformation by educating the people on the benefits of getting vaccinated, Dr. Faisal said, “Nigeria and the rest of the world need to end the pandemic, recover from its economic adversities, and return to normalcy. However, getting this done will be difficult if we do not face the issues of misinformation and disinformation squarely.” Speaking at the press conference, Country Representative, World Health Organization, Dr. Walter Kazadi Mulombo lauded the use of Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) to ease the registration and profiling of clients during vaccination and in improving primary healthcare services in the country. He said “at the global level WHO is calling for a moratorium on boosters until the end of September to enable at least 10% of the population of every country to be vaccinated. I will like to encourage NPHCDA and the federal government to work towards that aim.” He observed that “the trend we see is each new wave strikes Africa faster and harder, reaching a higher number of new cases more rapidly than the previous waves, putting an increasing strain on already stretched health facilities and the health workers.” He, however, expressed optimism that increasing vaccine supply raises hopes that the continent will meet the target of vaccinating 10% of the population by the end of September. He urged Nigerians to continue observing the non-pharmaceutical measures of avoiding unnecessary travels, social distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing face masks. Also, UNICEF Country Representative to Nigeria, Dr. Peter Hawkins said the second phase of Nigeria’s vaccination exercise offers an opportunity for citizens who are due for their second dose to get vaccinated for maximum protection against COVID-19. While calling on health workers and frontline workers who have not been vaccinated to avail themselves of vaccination, the UNICEF helmsman said vaccines are beginning to be readily and continually available in the country.", "date_published": "09, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 11:29:34"}

The Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib made this known during the weekly press briefing to update Nigerians on the vaccination rollout. Dr. Faisal said for the administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the Agency has mapped out the hard-to-reach areas across all states, such as security-compromised, riverine, nomadic and border settlements where the vaccines would be deployed to. He also said the reason for targeting the areas with the Johnson & Johnson is because of geographical constraints. “As a one-dose vaccine, it removes the additional logistic cost for going to the communities twice.” He stressed that “We have developed the necessary protocols to guide the States and ensure compliance with the distribution guideline for the vaccine.” The ED further explained that “the AstraZeneca vaccine will be used as the second dose for those who have received their first dose during the first phase to ensure they are fully protected.” He said, “the administration of AstraZeneca vaccine will commence on the 25th of August and will close on 5 of September,” adding that “As we receive more supplies, we will then open it up for those who may wish to take their first dose.” He urged Nigerians aged 18 years and above who have not been vaccinated to “visit any of our vaccination sites to receive their first dose of Moderna vaccine.” He called on persons who have been vaccinated “to continue to observe the non-pharmaceutical measures such as wearing of facemask, observing hand hygiene, physical distancing, and avoiding crowds and unnecessary travels until the country achieves herd immunity.” Also speaking at the press briefing, Country Representative of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Walter Kazadi Mulombo said the country like any other country in the world is experiencing the 3 wave of the pandemic and called on Nigerians to avail themselves for vaccination. He said for now vaccines are the most potent tool against the disease, adding that “all vaccines that have been approved by NAFDAC have been certified by the WHO. They are safe and effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death.” Country Representative of UNICEF, represented by Dr. Gagan Gupta, called on health workers who by their jobs are exposed to the virus to shun all forms of apprehension and not only take the vaccine but also to be advocates by propagating the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.", "date_published": "08, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 11:29:34"}

At the Press Conference to Update Nigerians on The Status of Covid-19 Vaccination on 15th June 2021", "body": "Good afternoon Ladies, and Gentlemen, and thank you for honouring our invitation again. Your commitment is indeed highly motivating and appreciated. Our dedicated teams continue to make strides in the vaccine rollout, working hand in hand with the local communities all across Nigeria. As of today, we have administered first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and second doses. I will once again remind those listening that we are advising that all Nigerians who have received their first dose to check their vaccination cards for the date of their first dose and ensure that they receive the second dose between 6 – 12 weeks after their 1 dose to gain full protection against COVID-19. Please note that in some cases the location of your second dose may be different from your first dose, so please be sure to confirm this. We have held town hall meetings in North Central and NorthEast zones across our country. While efforts to ensure supply of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria are ongoing, the Presidential Steering Committee this week will be having our planned South-South Zonal Town Hall Meeting with stakeholders and the larger communities on COVID-19 vaccination in Benin, Edo State. We are fully committed to going to communities to discuss directly our vaccine effort, the importance of staying safe and protected against COVID-19 and answering questions people have. We have been really grateful for the high levels of participation and interest in these events. We are confident that through continued awareness raising, we will be able to keep communities safe and healthy. I therefore urge all Nigerians who have received their first dose at  least six weeks ago to visit the nearest vaccination site to receive their  second dose, for  full protection against COVID-19 on or before 25 June when we shall close the administration of the second dose. Recall that we officially closed the vaccination for the first dose on 24 May 2021. Since then, we have been inundated with request by Nigerians to be vaccinated. In response, we have decided to reopen vaccination for the first dose from today. This means anyone 18 years and above who has not been vaccinated should visit the nearest vaccination site for the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. For such persons, their second dose will be due in 12 weeks and by then we would have received the next consignment of vaccines. We now have information that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/Astrazeneca by end of July or early August. As we receive additional information on the exact dates in August, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of this. Recent research from Public Health England (PHE) shows that the Indian (Delta) variant B.1.617.2 is 92% susceptible to Oxford/Astrazeneca. It is therefore comforting to know that the vaccine used in Nigeria can protect against this variant that caused high morbidity and mortality in India. However, it underscores the need for us to ramp up our vaccination to more Nigerians. As you all are aware, hesitancy towards the second dose is very tied to the continued misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccination program globally and locally. This is especially prevalent on social media. While I commend the patriotism of a multitude of our social media influencers, I must say that I profoundly appreciate the contributions our professional media community has been making towards the progress of COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nigeria. Nevertheless, the challenge is upon us to go beyond straight news and do more in educating Nigerians through interpretative stories, promotional exclusives, features and special broadcast programs on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. It is important to emphasize the need to be fully protected with the second dose, and the socio-economic and health risks of refusing to be vaccinated. We will not be tired of calling upon you, the media, as we are confident that you will not relent in bringing to bear on COVID-19, the sheer patriotism and professional prowess you demonstrated in our collective and successful fight against polio in Nigeria. Again, our goal is to do everything possible to educate, combat misinformation, and engender confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, and to ensure all Nigerians have clear information on how, where, and when to get the vaccine. While we are working with our international partners to confirm the next shipment of vaccines to Nigeria, I wish to speak about the G7 summit that occurred over the weekend. The topic of global inequities in the vaccine supply was a significant focus of the G7 meeting. Rightfully so. Leaders of major, rich countries are becoming increasingly aligned with the thinking that the inequities cannot continue – not only because it is a moral failure but because it is strategically unwise for their own efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.  On the final day of the summit, leaders committed to delivering at least 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the world over the next year. While this will not close the enormous gap that exists today, it is a positive step and we welcome the new focus. Additionally, President Biden announced on the eve of the summit that the US will purchase 500 million doses of the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine and donate them to low- and middle-income countries through the next year. This pledge is by far the largest yet by one country. These doses will be distributed via Covax. We welcome this announcement and encourage other nations with the means to follow the US’ example so that we, as a global community, can move forward from COVID-19 swiftly. In other positive news, the Mastercard Foundation has pledged to donate $1.3 billion for vaccines in Africa over the next three years in partnership with the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is one of the largest corporate donations of the pandemic, globally. The goals of this cooperation are to strengthen the Africa CDC’s capacity, support local vaccine manufacturing, procure vaccines for at least 50 million people, and help deliver shots to millions more. We applaud Mastercard’s decision, and hope it will serve as an impetus for other corporations to follow with similar efforts. Finally, I want to ensure that everyone is aware that there has been a rise in COVID-19 cases in several African countries recently. All Nigerians must continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Wearing a face covering over your nose and mouth in public spaces can save lives. A curfew remains in place from midnight until 4am every day. Indoor gatherings must be limited to 50 people, and are only permitted if all attendees abide by social distancing and wear face masks. And the government has introduced restrictions on incoming travel from high-risk countries and quarantine requirements to keep Nigerians safe. With a virus like COVID-19, we each must do our part to keep our communities safe. With that, I will turn it over to questions. Thank you for listening. God bless you, and God bless Nigeria.

At The Weekly Media Briefing on progress of Covid-19 Vaccination in nigeria, Held on Tuesday 6th July 2021 in Abuja.", "body": "First, I want to acknowledge the tremendous work that you members of the media have been doing to convey accurate and up to date information about Covid-19 to all Nigerians. Looking back, it’s hard to imagine how we could have contained this pandemic without you by our side, supporting the PSC and shaping the narrative. We thank you. As you may already be aware, we are witnessing an increasing wave of COVID-19 that should leave any patriotic Nigerian wondering how long mischief makers want the world to remain in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic itself. The creativity with which some people misinform others and spread misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccination calls for more deliberate, decisive, and consistent steps to counter as well as provide correct and accurate information that will help more people to make informed decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It is unfortunate that the right of the public to true and accurate information on matters of collective concern is being threatened by just a few others who are taking advantage of the social media to mislead people about their health. Let me quickly state here that this breach of public right to true and accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination is a challenge to the media, which should be taken seriously. It is evident that Nigeria has made significant progress towards utilizing the 4 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine we got from COVAX facility, and that is why our vaccine roll out has been described as the best in the African sub-region. As the country prepares to receive additional vaccine supply to commence phase 2 of its strategic vaccination plan, our attention has been drawn to, yet another level of disinformation targeted at discouraging people from seeking vaccination against COVID-19. The anti-vaccination elements have come up with magnetic conspiracy, in which they claim, and are deceiving people with videos, that COVID-19 vaccine creates magnetic field around vaccination site and can cause the body to light up an electric bulb. As ridiculous as this and other conspiracy theories are, vulnerable people believe them and are therefore continuing to take the risk of avoiding COVID-19 vaccination. Although the people who are manufacturing conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are in the minority, the virulence of the social media increases their reach. For this reason, ladies, and gentlemen, it has become necessary for us to confront the false theorists if we really want Nigeria and the world to overcome COVID-19 and recover from its adversities. At the onset, it was claimed that COVID-19 was introduced to justify developing vaccines that would be used to depopulate Africans. Those who came up with this theory said that anybody who takes the vaccine would die immediately. Today, as we all can see, nearly 4 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in Nigeria and we have not recorded any case of death linked to the vaccination. On seeing this reality, the rumour mongers changed their narratives into saying that the vaccines used in Europe and America are not the same as the ones used in Africa. Again, as evidence have come to show, it is now clear that the COVID-19 vaccines used in Europe, America and elsewhere in the World are the same used in Nigeria and other countries in Africa. The conspiracy theorist went silent about this claim and are now saying that anyone who takes the vaccine will die after two years. Nigerians are predominantly a country of Muslims and Christians. We know that these religions are clear that no-one knows the year of the day they will die. So why would we even pay attention to such spurious claims? Distinguished members of the press let us not forget that this same falsehood of children dying after vaccination was spread about Polio vaccine, but after many years, children who took polio vaccine are still alive and have grown into adulthood and having their own children, as expected. There has not been any case of a child’s death that is linked to polio vaccination, and many more children have been born to discount another claim that polio vaccination would lead to infertility. Today as I speak, 2,495,632 people have been vaccinated with the first dose, while 1,370,130 have received their second dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. Overall, Nigeria has successfully utilized 3.9M doses, representing 96% of the 4,024,000 doses of the vaccines received in the country. Nigeria is poised to achieve 100% utilization of the doses of vaccine it has received in the next few days. This is to ensure that people are protected against COVID-19, and normalcy is restored. We must take informed steps to guard ourselves from being misled by those who are spreading misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccines. It is important for our media to understand that the TRUTH, which they hold so high in principle, is at war with falsehood, and therefore every effort must be made to ensure that people are vaccinated against COVID-19 if we want TRUTH to be victorious. Today I would like to make very clear and demonstrate publicly that COVID-19 vaccine does not create any magnetic effect around the vaccination site or any part of the body for that matter, neither does it cause the body to light up an electric bulb. It is also a well-known fact that persons with wet, moist, or sticky skin can have objects stuck to their skin especially in smooth areas. Strong friction also allows for objects to stick to the skin. COVID -19 vaccines do not contain any metal – this is another fact! So how can it generate magnetic field or light an electric bulb? Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I would urge everyone to please do more research on your own using credible information sources so that we do not promote ignorance in an age of civilization. Finally, I would like to assure Nigerians that the Presidential Steering Committee and indeed the Federal Government is committed to providing safe and effective vaccination against COVID-19 in Nigeria. Their Excellencies, President Muhmmadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other strategic leaders, have taken their first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. This is the leadership by example that Nigerians want to see, and our President and his team has shown demonstrated this unequivocally. It therefore behoves every one of us to seek correct and accurate information about COVID-19 from credible sources so that we can make the right decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19! Meanwhile, I urge everyone to and continue to wear your face masks, wash your hands frequently, observe social distancing and take other precautionary measures against COVID-19. Stay safe and Thank you for listening!", "date_published": "07, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 11:29:34"}

The inauguration, held with the traditional leaders from the South-West region in attendance, fashioned out modalities on how to deliver the best of primary health care to the people. In his opening remarks, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi Ojaja II appreciated the Ministry of Health and the NPHCDA for the good initiative and promised to mobilize all traditional rulers in the South-West including their subjects towards achieving the noble goal. He said as royal fathers they were connected with the people, hence the decision to partner with them was a welcome development. He thanked the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, and the Executive Director NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, for showing commitment to the health care of Nigerians and tasked them to do more. He appealed to the Minister to as a matter of urgency reconcile with the striking doctors to enable them to resume work in the interest of Nigerians. In his address, Dr. Shuaib appreciated the Ooni of Ife for graciously accepting their invitation to the event. Taking the audience through memory lane, he said, “In 2009, the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Alhaji Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar established a Northern traditional leaders’ committee to support the government effort to eradicate polio and improve the health status of Nigeria and today polio has been eradicated in our country.” Dr. Shuaib thanked the royal fathers for being supportive of government health programmes over the years and promised to always collaborate with them. He advised Nigerians to as a matter of urgency get vaccinated as vaccines are available at all vaccination points in Nigeria. He also called on Nigerians to follow all the COVID-19 protocols after been vaccinated. On his part, the Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire stressed the importance of the role of traditional rulers in nation-building and assured them of the commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari to the health needs of Nigerians. He said, “I am pleased to say that the traditional rulers have been playing a key role in public health and partnering in our health care system. When the case of COVID-19 came out, the traditional rulers pledged their support for the federal government and fully engaged in mobilization and advocacy to help stem community transmission of the virus. This act has saved many from contacting the virus.” The Minister further said, “The primary health care centres are going to be a platform to educate, enlighten and build awareness especially among rural communities on the method of disease prevention.” He then appealed to partners and donors to pull their resources in support of this project. On their part, County Representative of WHO, Mr. Kazadi Walter Molumbo, UNICEF Country Representative, Peter Hawkins represented by Dr. Mohammed O. Okori, the representative of Rotary International Mr. Gbenga Olayuwale, promised to always support the Nigerian government on health issues.
