Comparing a child’s weight with norms for its length/height has been proven as an effective way to assess for both overweight and wasting. Where infants and children are identified as overweight, the World Health Organization recommends the provision of counselling services to parents and caregivers on nutrition and physical activity including encouragement for exclusive breastfeeding for first 6 months of life and continued until 24 months or beyond. If a child is obese, there should be further assessment and an appropriate plan should be developed for the management of the condition.. This can be achieved by a health workers at primary health-care level, if they are adequately trained. In Addition, moderate wasting and stunting are potential risk factors for children becoming obese or overweight. In order to avoid the risk of overweight and obesity the World Health Organization recommends that formulated supplementary foods should not be provided on a routine basis to children who are moderately wasted or stunted.

Following the release of a memo from the office of the minister of health Prof Isaac Adewole dated 12th July 2017, suspending the Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) a parasternal under his ministry, the embattled Executive Secretary Prof Usman Yusuf, refused to comply with the suspension order given to him by the minister, insisting that according to law only the President can suspend or remove him from office.  Despite the insistence of the ministry that Yusuf, being a public officer, was bound by the regulations governing the public service, the Executive Secretary refused to bulge insisting that by virtue of  Section 4 and 8 of the NHIS Act , his  appointment and removal from office, whether by way of suspension or otherwise, is at the instance of the President. In his reply to the Ministers letter suspending him, the executive Secretary averred that “Except removed from office by the President under circumstances specified in the NHIS Act, his appointment is for a period of five years, subject to further term of the same period at the discretion of the President. Although  he admitted that by virtue of Section 47 of the NHIS Act, the minister is empowered to give directives of a general nature to the Governing Council of the scheme and in the absence of the Council, but he stated that the  mandate is to exercise the powers and functions of the council, but since the powers and functions of the Council does not include discipline, suspension or removal of the Executive Secretary of the scheme from office, the directive in the letter under reference cannot find comfort under the said section or presidential mandate. This is not the first time a head of an agency is been suspended by a minister under this administration, it will be recalled that on Jan 20th 2016 , The Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, suspended the director-general of the National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA, Peter Jack, indefinitely for alleged “misconduct unbecoming of a public officer of his cadre. Information available to this medium shows that the cabal in the presidency is hell bent on frustrating any attempt to edge out or humiliate any appointee they installed. The embattled executive secretary according to a source is dancing to a beat being played by some invisible hands within the presidency who are hell bent on frustrating the acting President. In a new twist, the House of representatives has directed the minister of a health to recall the suspended NHIS chief. The legislators also resolved to invite the minister to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt of the House as it viewed the suspension as an attempt to intimidate and punish the executive secretary for testifying before the House as well as silence him from further testifying before the lower chamber in its constitutional duties of investigation of issues of corruption, inefficiency and waste in governance. During a hearing organized by the House of Representatives, Yusuf had insisted that none of the 57 HMOs had a valid license as most of their accreditation had expired and vowed to ensure that HMO’s owing health providers, would not be re-accredited.  He likened operations of the HMO’s to the fraud in the fuel subsidy scheme, stressing that they are padding figures of enrollees so they could get paid. However, insiders within the NHIS insisted that the suspended Executive secretary was only trying to divert attention from the monumental fraud and underhand dealings that he supervised while at the helm of affairs.

Most cases have no symptoms, but when present they are usually mild and can resemble dengue fever. Symptoms may include fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, and a maculopapular rash. Zika virus disease is caused by the Zika virus, which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus).However, Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe brain defects. One is that the virus can be sexually transmitted. Another is Zika has been detected in the semen of men months after they were infected. The researchers detected Zika virus in the testicles and other parts of the male reproductive system within a week of infection with either of the two strains. The CDC currently recommends that men who have traveled to a Zika-active region either use condoms or abstain from sex for at least 6 months. But that guideline is based on data showing that genetic traces of Zika virus can be found in semen 180 days after infection. Symptoms usually show up two to 12 days after a mosquito bite, and they tend to go away within a week. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon, and death is rare. As with any virus, however, your chances of complications with the virus increase if you have underlying medical conditions. Usually patients recover but it kills about 1 percent of victims. And the birth defects are certainly deadly. When a baby has severe brain damage, it can die while still in the womb or at birth. Babies have died of other, unknown causes when the mother’s been infected with Zika. Symptoms of Zika virus infection If symptoms do occur, they’re usually mild and last around 2 to 7 days. No specific antiviral treatment for the Zika virus exists. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms with rest, fluids and medications — such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) — to relieve joint pain and fever. No vaccine exists to prevent the Zika virus. But several vaccines are currently in clinical trials. The CDC has confirmed active local Zika virus transmission in the following foreign countries and territories: Angola. Anguilla. Antigua and Barbuda. Argentina. Aruba. Barbados. Belize. Bolivia.

Despite its importance, the IDSR strategy still suffers some setbacks especially in developing countries including Nigeria . The weaknesses in the IDSR strategy in most countries had resulted in failures in detecting epidemics with an attendant spread of diseases and associated human suffering, and loss of lives . The flow of information in the IDSR system in Nigeria is from the health facility to the Local Government Area (LGA), then to State Ministry of Health (SMOH) and finally to Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH). At the FMOH, data are collated and forwarded to the statistics division, analysis and feedback is carried out, as well as planning for appropriate intervention based upon the results of analysis . In this regards, primary health care workers at the LGA level remains the mainstay of an effective and functional surveillance system. Apart from being a prerequisite for an effective surveillance system, Health Care Workers’ (HCWs) knowledge of IDSR also enhances the performance of both technical and organizational tasks . Similarly, knowledge amongst other factors has been identified to greatly influence HCWs’ attitude towards reporting of EPDs . Despite this, the knowledge of reporting requirements and responsibilities among HCWs has not been examined adequately as a cause of under-reporting. In Nigeria, the collection, collation, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data in healthcare facilities are often unsatisfactory, and this has been attributed partly to insufficient awareness and knowledge among HCWs on the importance of this process . This is particularly important especially in the area of core IDSR activities like case definition, case detection, case registration, case reporting and data management. Public health agencies have played a leading role in designing, developing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating IDSR since its inception in 1988. With funding from development partners the  IDSR team across the world continue to  collaborate with WHO/AFRO to lead the development of the IDSR framework and the design and development of the Technical Guidelines for Integrated Disease Surveillance and the IDSR Training Modules. In addition, CDC programs across the agency reviewed and cleared summary guidelines for the framework’s 40 priority diseases, which include those diseases, syndromes, and conditions targeted by the International Health Regulations (2005). Strengthening laboratory support to surveillance also is a cornerstone of the IDSR strategy, and CDC’s global laboratory programs have provided guidance on strengthening laboratory networks, accreditation, and external quality assurance for national public health laboratories.For more information about IDSR.

The Act established the framework for the Regulation, Management and Development of a National Health System and also set standards for rendering health services and other related matters. One of the major objectives of the Act is the elimination of quacks and the promotion of professionalism in the health sector. The Act also seeks to help Nigeria reduce maternal and infant mortality rates amongst several other laudable objectives including the achievement of key Millennium Development Goals. (See Download links Below) Click on The Link Below to Download The  Full List of Notifiable Diseases and The Standard Case Definition of Priority Diseases and Conditions In Nigeria THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT 2014 AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NIGERIAN HEALTH WORKER:  A KEYNOTE ADDRESS PRESENTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF NIGERIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (NMA) SIR DR LAWRENCE KAYODE OBEMBE ON THE OCCASION OF A PUBLIC AWARENESS CONFERENCE ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT BY THE ACE MEDICARE CLINICS LIMITED ON TUESDAY 15 DECEMBER 2015. Protocols: It is no longer news that the NATIONAL HEALTH ACT which had a long gestation period of ten solid years from 2004 -2014 has eventually been delivered and its implementation begun in the eyes of the law. What is news is that for the first time since the existence of our nation, there is now a legal backing for the regulation, development, and management of our health system and setting of standards for delivering health care to our citizens. Prior to October 31, 2014 when Pres. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan GCFR signed the bill into law, healthcare delivery was just a matter of prediction of the body language of the various political leaders; nothing compelling anyone to do anything. Going down memory lane, the 1959 Constitution placed health on the Concurrent Legislative List as responsibilities of the both the Federal and Regional Governments without clear cut lines of responsibility or collaboration. In the 1979 Constitution, health was on the Concurrent Legislative List as responsibilities of the Federal and State Governments; same lacunae persisted. In the 1999 Constitution and even with the amendment, health was neither included under the Exclusive nor the Concurrent Legislative List- perhaps not considered important as at that time left to God as most Nigerians resort to when helpless. Although Health is merely mentioned in the 1999 Constitution in chapter II, Section 17 that deals with the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State (Government shall serve to provide security and welfare of citizens of which health is one but not expressly mentioned), that, gave health a status of a right but one that is not justiciable or enforceable by law. There is also a mention of health in the Fourth schedule in connection with the functions of a Local Government Council which states – ‘Local Governments shall participate in the provision and maintenance of health services’; This does not make LG responsible for PHC as erroneously perceived by several people. Also out of the 68 items in the Constitution’s Exclusive Legislative list, there was no guarantee of healthcare, except for a mention of Drugs and Poisons as item 21 and in the Concurrent list where health was only mentioned in relation to industrial safety out of the 30 items. In the absence of a Constitutional or any other legal outlining and assignment of responsibilities for healthcare, the “1988 National Health Policy and Strategy to Achieve Health for All Nigerians” assigned primary healthcare to local governments; secondary healthcare to state governments; and tertiary healthcare to the federal government. This stop gap measure wasn’t backed by any form of legislation and lacked the power of enforcement, hence health care delivery continued to suffer as no level of authority or governance could be held liable by any law except good conscience which obviously appeared to be in a comatose state among many leaders in Nigeria. The practical meaning of the absence of an unambiguous legal provision for healthcare delivery in Nigeria characterised Nigerian healthcare delivery sector with the following features: There is no clear definition of roles and responsibilities in health for the different tiers of government. All the tiers are involved in various aspects of the healthcare delivery; doing similar things very poorly- inefficiently and ineffectively. The result is the perennial abysmal indices which our country has become known for. The health sector was hitherto thrown into chaos as adequate coordination and collaboration on health matters by different tiers of government became a very scare commodity. The worst implication of the pre-NHAct 2014 situation is the chronic under-funding of the health sector. That despite being a signatory to various treaties and agreements even the one signed by African heads of government in Abuja in 2001, public healthcare expenditure as a percentage of the GDP continued to be laughable for a country that was in the pit of gravely poor health indices was worrisome. The unregulated scenario was fraught with lack of accountability with regards to the provision and financing of health services- many cared less, the people suffered various diseases and died, yet no one was held responsible for this brazen act of mis-governance. The other ills of the dark days include absence of effective linkages and referrals within the health system; lack of standards or regulation for health related researches; inter-sectoral collaboration and enforcement of rights of the patients including confidentiality of their information; and those of the practitioners and even strike actions by health workers. Industrial disputes occasioned mainly by inter-professional rivalry and inability of the various governments to keep to agreements of collective bargaining offered more confounding fumes that fanned the embers of a collapsing system. SEE: In providing the frame work for setting and maintaining standards for development, regulation and management of the national health system and setting standards for healthcare delivery in Nigeria, the NHAct 2014 bridges the legal lacunae through the following mechanisms and processes; Establishment of the hitherto non-existent National Health System(this means the structure and function of the Nigerian national health system as a national identity peculiar to us which is tailored towards solving our own needs with home grown initiatives. As part of the above, the National Council on Health (NCH) the highest policy making organ for health in Nigeria with the composition, functions and modus operandi for the first time has been established by law through this act. The Act has also made provision for the eradication of mushroom facilities at all levels of care with the provision of Health Institutions Standards Committee whose duty would be to set standards in terms of location, equipment, staffing, etc, of public and private health institutions- classification of health establishment, technologies and certificate of standards, including offences and penalties in respect of Certificate of Standards. Perhaps, the loftiest provision of this act is the establishment of the Basic HealthCare Provision Fund (BHPF) which would be financed from the first line charge of not less than 1% of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the federation and other sources- the surest guarantee come rain, come shine. This prescribes a basic healthcare package every Nigerian would be entitled to. This fund would be disbursed through the National/state/LGAs Primary Healthcare development agencies, the National Health Insurance Scheme, provision of essential drugs, maintenance of healthcare infrastructure, and development of human resources for health and subsidies for emergency medical treatments which has caused many Nigerian private healthcare practitioners sleepless nights. There are several other lofty provisions in this mother law of health in Nigeria- best described as the best thing that has happened to health care delivery in Nigeria. What are the direct responsibilities of doctors and other health workers in connection with the National Health Act 2014? In as much as the law has provided most if not all that had been lacking to move our health sector forward, let me warn that there is a huge burden on the part of practitioners as there are now clear cut sanctions for wrong doing and provisions to keep us on our toes 24/7. The Act provides for a free Basic Healthcare package for all Nigerians and even age-based exemption from payment for healthcare services. For most Nigerians, this is fait accompli. However, it still exists on paper. The year 2015 has run out without any mention for the provision of that Basic Health Care Fund (BHCF) in the main appropriation or the supplementary budgets. 2016 is around the corner and to the best of my knowledge; it is still unclear if this BHCF would be captured even as our national revenue is plunging deeper and deeper into the red. Most unfortunately, the only ones Nigerians can see and complain to, is the health worker. They do not have access to their political leaders. Soon patients would be demanding that they be treated free of charge because the law provides for emergency medical treatment; what they do not know is that the modality for translating the provisions into reality is still a mirage. It also behoves on medics to educate the public what an emergency medical condition is. This is necessary before ill intended legal fires start appearing from various angles as conviction under Part III Section 1 sub (2) is six months imprisonment or ₦100,000.00 option of fine or both. Therefore, health workers should stand up and make a strong demand to governments to kick start the implementation of the National Health Act with the establishment of the governance structures and other implementation platform sine qua non to the actualisation of the lofty provisions of the Act. Healthcare workers should be aware that under the dispensation of the NHAct 2014, the era of establishing mushroom contraptions and operating them as health facilities is over. Part II section 2 of this law prescribes a punishment of two years imprisonment or an option of N500,000.00 fine if found guilty of operating a health facility, health agency or health technology  without a Certificate of Standards 24 months from October 31 , 2014 when the Act started being effective. Related to this is the cautious warning given to private healthcare providers in Part IV section 7. The message is that it is no longer business as usual as it relates to standards of practice, health information management and compliance to other provisions of the act. A six (6) months imprisonment or ₦100,000.00 option of fine or both, awaits defaulters. Perhaps, the best implementation strategy as well captured in this law is the prescription in Part V section 6 which regulates overseas medical treatment. Should government officials who are entrusted with provision of efficient healthcare delivery to the people be made to eat from the same pot of food they are serving the populace, it is reasonable to posit that health institutions would once more be restored back to the former glory exemplified by the state of UCH in the 60s. The NHAct provides that timely referral of patients to where they can access better care is now mandatory under Part II section (7) of the Act. This for the first time removes the liability from that of good conscience to an issue of law. There is therefore a need to provide an effective framework to translate the provision into actionable program where referral as well as feed back to the referring hospital would be better coordinated to impact of patients’ survival outcomes and improving healthcare information for good of all. On the other hand, one of the issues begrudging effective coordination especially in delivering medical services is the cold relationship between the private and public sector health care workers. Collaboration between public and private health institutions is now legalised as provided for in Part II section (8) and no longer predictions of body language of who calls the shots in the administrative apparatus of health. In fact, this opens greater rooms for the much touted public private partnership (PPP) options in the health sector. Does it make sense that an institution is a jack of all trades but master of none? This provision would indeed open up greater opportunities for our colleagues in the Diaspora to come and contribute their quota to health care delivery in our nation under a guaranteed enduring investment climate. Furthermore, our clients who are eventually mistreated now have an easier modality of redressing service failure. It reduces the burden of going through say the MDCN through the rigorous path of sworn affidavit. This Act provides for simpler complaints laying procedure that would redress criminal negligence, infamous conduct as well as vicarious liability (Part III Section 10).Therefore, the proponents of Medical Negligence Bill proposed in the 7 House of Representatives can now go to sleep as a more decent way of ensuring that misdeeds of health workers are redressed is available. The National Health Act 2014 is not only about prescription of sanctions for wrong doing. It promotes availability, effectiveness, efficiency and coordination in the public health sector and protection of the wellbeing of the practitioner. In part II section 11, the healthcare provider for the first time aside fundamental human rights guaranteed under the 1999 constitution as amended, now has a protected right to exist and be treated fairly. The training, development and welfare of health workers are not also neglected in this law as part part III section 11 sub section 1-3 assures that the health worker be not abused, assaulted or subjected to other forms of mistreatments. This is a welcome development as a core pillar of Clinical Governance which protects patients and care givers in tandem. One of the ills of our health sector is the skewed distribution of human resources for health in favour of the urban areas rather than rural where the burden of disease is highest. Addressing this challenge, part V of this Act makes ample provisions for availability, development, management and utilization of well-trained human resources at all levels within the national health system and even empowers the honorable Minister of health to create new categories or cadres of health care personnel in conjunction with the appropriate authority (sub section 3c) according to the need of the sector. Therefore, the era of splinter groups to go through the back door to carve out professional cadres from mere technical level and fueling industrial disharmony is over. This function has now been assigned to the Minister of Health though without prejudice to laws that may be enacted by various states houses of Assemblies. Recognising one of the worst nightmares clogging the wheel of progress of healthcare delivery in Nigeria, the mother law of health administration in Nigeria the NHAct 2014 was bold in assigning the minister of health the responsibility to resolve industrial disputes in the health sector within fourteen (14) days. Part V section 5 of this law puts the government bureaucracy headed by the Minister on his toes to ensure industrial harmony especially as it concerns respect for and implementation of agreements within a reasonable period. Perhaps the thorniest issue which bedeviled the earlier passage and assent of this Act is the poor understanding of Part VI which deals with control of blood, blood products, tissue and gametes in humans. Whereas this area is purely prohibitive of experiments with human gametes or zygotes and provides serious regulatory mechanisms and processes against frivolous human organ donation, certain faith based organisations and their allies allege unfounded insinuations against the true spirit and letter of this law. I therefore refer all to carefully peruse Part VI of this Act and judge for yourselves if imposing unambiguous restrictions against toying with human lives right from conception or racketeering trade with human organs is not necessary. The NHAct does not permit abortions nor does it encourage reproductive or therapeutic cloning of human kind for any reason whatsoever. The Act ends with Part VII which defines several terminologies and provides explanatory notes on several provisions to promote clear understanding of this piece of legislation. Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would end this keynote address by reminding us that it would be better for Healthcare personnel to spearhead the implementation of this law. If we take the lead, we would be able to offer explanations and clearly provide definitions to ambiguous technical terminologies, if any, which only the medical world could get to their deepest root meanings. The time to educate fellow citizens about the workings of health institutions, what to do when ill; how to access care, how to redress mistreatments and service failures amongst other rights and privileges guaranteed in this piece of legislation is now. The earlier we start the better for all of us. If we hesitate further, Lawyers would start making a minced meat of our profession and feed fat from our ignorance or indecision. The medical community should and must take the lead in mobilising our nation towards the actual implementation of this Act. This starts with understanding what the provisions of the law are. Infact, if possible, I would encourage every healthcare worker to memorise essential sections of this Act. It is on this note that I salute the efforts of Ace Medicare Clinics ltd the organisers of this very important educational programme. Knowledge is power. Thank you very much. As we say good bye to the era of poor access to health care, stock-out syndrome of essential drugs and vaccines, skewed health manpower distribution, mushroom health facilities, hospitals turned to “mere consulting clinics” unregulated and unethical health researches, assault on health workers, total paralyzing strikes that leave the nation no option than unnecessary death of the citizens, etc; let us ponder and appreciate the efforts of several compatriots who worked in the open and in the secret towards the actualisation of this legislation. We would not forget that it is the Change Agent Program spearheaded by the erudite WHO-classed Health Economics Prof. Eyitayo Lambo who using the evidence that health systems governed by an over-arching law perform better, that began this revolution.  We would not forget the committed efforts of Sen. Dr. Martins Yellowe and Sen. Dr. Gyang Dalyop Dantong now both of the blessed memory that were there at the National Assembly in the 5 , 6 and 7 Assemblies accordingly. We appreciate the dexterity of Sen. Dr Iyabo Obasanjo Bello, HE Sen. Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu and their various committee members; the Health Sector Reform Coalition with membership drawn from professional Associations in the Health sector, CSOs, NGOs and the federal ministry of Health for a job well done. It would be recalled that the three succeeding NOCs of NMA neither slept nor slumbered because of the actualisation of the National Health Act. I remember that NMA took the decision to champion the actualisation of this law at the National Health Summit convened by the Nigerian Medical Association proudly sponsored and hosted by one of our members HE Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan the immediate past executive governor of Delta state in January 2013. He also sponsored the historic and legendary match on Abuja streets for this purpose on the occasion of the Senate public hearing for the Bill in March 2013 which NMA members attended from the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. The state chapters made it points-of-duty to raise the issue of passage of the Bill into law at every forum including sponsored press conferences. I salute them all. Providence once more decided to honour me as the president of NMA in whose hands the National Health Act would be delivered. I am immensely honoured. As the nation looks forward for speedier implementation of this law, join me to share the cautious optimism that Nigeria’s health system is perhaps on its path to recovery if the lofty provisions are implemented.  Thank you all for listening.

As the disease wreaks its havoc in areas poorly equipped to handle its spread, terrorism likely will increase there as well. We are political scientists who study the and . Our recently identifies a potential link between the pandemic and an uptick in violence. We find that food insecurity – the lack of both financial and physical access to nutritious food, which leads to malnutrition and undernourishment in a population – makes citizens angry at their governments. Citizens conclude that their political leaders are either unable or unwilling to ease their suffering. This anger gives terrorist groups opportunities to recruit new members by providing them a violent outlet for venting their frustrations. In many cases, terrorist organizations do what their governments can’t or won’t do: give people the food and money they badly need to survive. Extreme weather, political conflict and economic shocks tend to , especially among children, the elderly, the poor and people with disabilities. In , about 55 countries from regions in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East and Asia were in food crisis. The even in wealthy countries. As the crisis extends to the developing world, nations will face serious problems feeding their people – and keeping the peace. The types of conflicts plaguing Africa before the pandemic arrived mostly consist of bands of terrorist organizations using violence to cause political or social changes in their home countries, such as Boko Haram’s violent insurgency in . These conflicts happen in places where the government is too weak to monitor and capture the terrorists and their group leaders. Due to weak governance and lack of border restrictions between countries, the violence often spills into weak states, enveloping entire regions. Even before the pandemic broke out, regional conflicts had already created food crises in parts of . The national lockdowns will help contain the coronavirus, but they also that can lead to violence. For example, Nigeria has a large number of who are now unable to earn a living due to the lockdown. As a result, they do not have , and the government has been unable to provide food to everyone in need. This food scarcity has led to in Abuja and food to collect food supplies from the government in Lagos, Nigeria. People are frustrated with the government’s response in dealing with the pandemic and its inability to provide essential food for all who need it. Terrorist organizations such as Boko Haram, an organization dedicated to the creation of an Islamic state within Nigeria, are actively using the grief caused by the coronavirus to their . Boko Haram is known for recruiting from families who live in poverty without sufficient food. The group is now of young men to carry out ambushes, kidnappings and bombings in the region. These efforts have resulted in renewed violence across the Lake Chad region, where a recent Boko Haram attack against the killed 47. In neighboring Chad, the group ambushed a large group of Chadian soldiers, killing 92. It was the on Chad’s military. Even as Nigeria is gradually lifting lockdown measures, is likely to persist, diminishing people’s ability to afford basic goods such as food. This pattern of violence is extending to other war-torn areas. and , for example, are experiencing an increase in attacks from Islamist insurgents in the wake of the pandemic. It is likely that food insecurity brought on by the coronavirus pandemic is playing a role there as well. In Asia, Pakistan was experiencing a before the pandemic began, with 60% of the population facing food insecurity because of drought and . Now, there are over 48,000 positive COVID-19 cases in . Lockdown measures are making it difficult for day laborers and tradesmen to earn a living, and is an even greater immediate concern. The government’s efforts to provide food to its citizens may not be able to meet the need. Particularly worrisome are the of Pakistani citizens who are illiterate and face difficulty reading and applying for aid. The worsening conditions in Pakistan brought on by the coronavirus are causing an in terrorism. The Pakistani-based terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad are currently approaching people who have been affected by the coronavirus and . In return, they and access to a new pool of recruits for their efforts to set up an Islamist government in the contested territory of Kashmir. The effort by the two terrorist groups has led to an in the region. Indian intelligence sources also indicate that the groups, along with their ally Hizbul Mujahideen, may in an effort to seize the contested land from the Indian government. We are seeing similar recruitment tactics in other parts of the continent. In , Islamic State recruiters are targeting migrants from Turkmenistan who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. The Islamic State frequently recruits unemployed and disillusioned individuals to join its efforts to create an independent state dedicated to the teachings of its extremist brand of Sunni Islam. Across the developing world, the coronavirus is magnifying existing societal problems, worsening food and financial shortages that give rise to terrorist violence.

South Sudan government this week begun screening all travelers at airports to help avert the spread of the coronavirus in the country. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The disease which started in the Chinese City of Wuhan late last month is reported to have already killed over 170 people with over 9,000 confirmed cases in all regions of China. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the virus a global health emergency after it spread to several countries.As part of response intervention, South Sudan launched a detective machine that will help to sense the virus in the human body.The Minister of Health says the launch is a preparedness measure to protect South Sudanese. Dr. Riak Gai Kok said South Sudan and China will not suspend travels between the two countries.“We will not suspend travels between China and South Sudan but we are appealing to people that you consider the fragility of our health system and the vulnerability of our people,” said the minister of health. He advised travelers to follow the regulations at airports knowing that South Sudan is vulnerable in handling any outbreak. “If one case is imported to South Sudan, it will be a disaster and we have abundance and surplus of problems.” “The WHO headquarters in Geneva has declared Coronavirus as a public health emergency of international concern that’s why also we have to be aware here in South Sudan and to be prepared. It’s not only confined to China,” said Dr. Riak Gai. “It has spread to so many countries and as you know there is heavy traffic between South Sudan and China.” The minister of health was speaking during the launch of the specialized equipment at Juba International Airport on Friday.nThe specialized equipment for detecting any infectious disease was donated by the government of Japan. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China has risen to 490 after more deaths were reported in Hubei province. The virus originated in Wuhan, Hubei’s provincial capital. A further 24,324 people on the Chinese mainland have been infected China’s National Health Commission said on Wednesday.   Your email address will not be published.

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/how-5g-networks-will-affect-healthcare/", "title": "How 5G Networks Will Affect Healthcare", "body": "      5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 20 networks. Speeds in a 100 MHz band are usually 100-400 megabits. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4 GHz to 4.2 GHz. Sprint and China Mobile are using 2.5 GHz spectrum. At the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona, Vodafone exhibited two new health telecoms technologies it has developed with 5G. The company has partnered with Barcelona’s San Raffaele hospital to develop 5G ambulances which allow paramedics to stream real-time HD video support from remote specialists while transporting patients. The extremely low latency of Vodafone 5G has also been used to allow specialist clinicians to guide surgeons in the operating room, long-distance but in real time. Vilicom head of consultancy and solutions Rui Inacio says: “The potential for collaboration is obvious – you can imagine a revered surgeon in the United States guiding a junior surgeon in Australia through a tricky procedure.” Over in China, 5G has enabled remote surgery to be performed using robotic arms, theoretically expanding patient access to highly specialised operations. In January 2019, a doctor in the southeastern province of Fuijan was able to remove the liver of a laboratory test animal from a remote location 30 miles from the operating theatre. Three months later, People’s Liberation Army General Hospital (PLAGH) chief physician Ling Zhipei took things a step further, operating on the brain of a Parkinson’s disease patient in Beijing from the PLAGH Hainan Hospital 3,000km away. When someone suffers a stroke, oxygen flow to the brain is impeded. Every second is critical. Imagine that a doctor could examine a patient in an ambulance remotely, and brain scans could be sent to the surgeon waiting to receive that patient. This is quickly becoming real. At Barcelona’s San Raffaele hospital, researchers are developing 5G-equipped ambulances that will allow remote specialists to view a patient in real time and deliver instructions as efficiently as if they were in the vehicle. At King’s College London, engineers are also focused on stroke victims: Using portable MRI equipment, a paramedic in an ambulance can scan a patient’s brain and upload the images to the cloud in seconds. A doctor can then review the images and give instructions on how to best position the patient’s head and body; a neurosurgeon can look at the same images and be ready to operate when the patient arrives. 5G will allow innovators to create technology that isn’t practical or feasible on existing networks. At New York University, engineers and physicians are testing a system for the visually impaired that detects obstacles and gives verbal cues through a headset or tactile cues through a haptic vest. Using 5G allows the system to map the world more accurately and with immediacy. “It operates in real time,” says Mahya Beheshti, an NYU physician-scientist. “It’s a completely smooth process.” Plus, 5G’s more efficient power usage means battery life is vastly improved, a critical feature for such devices. Mischa Dohler, chair professor of wireless communications at King’s College, likes to say that 5G will lead to the “internet of skills”–that is, a system by which a person’s physical abilities can be wirelessly transferred. For example, a doctor in one location could train the hands of another somewhere else using haptic gloves. Or surgery could be performed remotely using robotic arms, only possible now using a fiber-optic connection. To demonstrate 5G’s instantaneousness, Dohler, playing piano in Berlin, recently accompanied a livestreamed hologram of his daughter as she sang in London. He envisions those kinds of interactions taking place between specialists and hospital workers, or between patients and doctors located halfway around the world. “It’s like Skype on steroids,” he says. With the new generation of wireless, face-to-face conversations can be held via phone or tablet as naturally as in person. Diagnoses can be made via live video chat, making the world’s best doctors available to people anywhere they live. Still, the ability to democratize access to health care will hinge on infrastructure. “If you look at all the plans that carriers have today for deploying 5G, it’s mostly in urban areas,” says Monisha Ghosh, wireless communications researcher at the University of Chicago. “5G makes many things possible. The question is when the carriers will roll it out to rural areas”–where hospitals are closing and remote health care is desperately needed. If 5G goes national quickly, it could be big news for startups like Seattle-based 98point6, whose app connects patients with doctors via text chat or video. “We’ve all had that experience where a mobile app fails us in a critical moment,” says chief technology officer Damon Lanphear. “And then you say, ‘Well, I’m not going to rely on this thing again.’ 5G has the potential to enhance that trust and let users feel like they can use our product when they need it, wherever they are.” The data-rich environment once again highlights privacy issues. “It would require an extra level of awareness and very careful management,” says Muriel Médard, professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But expect a solution, because the potential benefits of 5G are vast–and the opportunities for health care entrepreneurs seemingly endless.   Your email address will not be published.

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/11-ways-men-and-women-cheat-on-their-partners/", "title": "11 Ways Men and Women Cheat On Their Partners", "body": "      Six women are seated around a living room table sipping merlot when the topic of infidelity surfaces. Each one has a different definition of cheating. “Infidelity begins when you overtly flirt with someone,” says the first. “I think cheating happens when you kiss … with tongue,” another chimes in. “What about an affair?” a third asks. “What qualifies as one?” “Sex,” two of them say out loud. “Just intercourse or does oral sex count?” another asks. This conversation represents the confusion associated with the word . I used to reserve the term only for relationships that passed the boundary into sexual intercourse, but that changed after watching a Ted Talk by affair expert Esther Perel called “ .”“Infidelity,” she explains, “includes one or more of these three constitutive elements: secrecy, sexual alchemy, and emotional involvement.” Following are short descriptions of eleven different types of affair: Men or women who go to any lengths to avoid any and all marital conflicts sometimes resort to affairs to have their needs, which were not expressed to their spouses, met. This type of affair usually does not last long and may repeat itself several times during the marriage. Intimacy avoiders” are frightened and therefore reluctant to be intimately close and use the affair to keep themselves at emotional distance from their spouse. The affair serves as an emotional-relational barrier in the marriage. This type of affair also usually does not last long and may repeat itself several times during the marriage. When both members of the couple are intimacy avoiders, this type affair can, in fact, help some couples sustain an emotionally distant marriage. Middle-age crises, empty nest, depression, sense of emptiness are factors that can fuel an affair. Men and women may turn to a lover to revitalize self, individuate or mask anxiety, depression or other unwelcome feelings that they experience as a result of the existential anxiety of facing one’s old age and mortality or one’s spiritual void. A partner may turn to an extramarital affair as a way to affirm their sense of masculinity or femininity. Some extramarital affairs are about yearning and loss and the freedom to enact one’s own desires and fantasies, which has very little to do with the marriage itself. #4 Sexual addicts, like any addicts, are compulsive and display poor impulse control. They use sex over and over again to numb inner pain and/or a sense of emptiness. Generally, among married couples, men are sexual addicts more often than women. Sexual addicts are compulsively attracted to the high and the anxiety release of sexual orgasm. But such release often comes with a price — feelings of shame and worthlessness. This type of affair is neither planned nor characteristic of the person. It “just happens” when a person is at the right (wrong) place at the right time; often it surprises the person who commits the infidelity. Curiosity, pity, drunkenness, and even politeness may lead to such a brief and often never to be repeated affair. Some individuals are prone to infidelity, often due to insecurity and low self-esteem and a constant need to “score,” conquer or get affirmation about themselves. Narcissistic and impulsive individuals may be especially prone to marital infidelity. Many men are socialized to ‘score’ and get reinforcement for womanizing. Philanderers perceive extramarital sex as an entitlement of gender or status and often take advantage of opportunities without guilt or withdrawal symptoms. Sometimes, one partner wants to “get back” at the other partner by having an affair. This may be payback for the other person having an affair, withholding money, love, emotion or any another perceived wrongdoing. This kind of affair is a direct result of a bad marriage with poor communication, intimacy, support or sexuality. It can also arise from incompatible cultural and familial values. When there is marital dissatisfaction, discontent and lack of love, one or both partners may be seeking comfort and intimacy in another lover’s arms. Dissatisfied spouses who experience their partners as emotionally or sexually withholding or view their partners as easily sexualizing others or as moody are especially vulnerable to affairs. “Affair exiters” use the affair as a jumping board to end a marriage. This can be a conscious or unconscious act intended to ensure that a backup relationship is in place before leaving the original marriage. The left-partner often blames the affair rather than looking at how their marriage got to this point. These kinds of affairs include those who are involved in long term extramarital relationships while continuing to be part of the original marital dyad. Examples of those are Spencer Tracy’s life long affair with Katharine Hepburn or Prince Charles’ long affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. Such extramarital relationships are often known, accepted or tolerated by the spouse and other family members but are neither addressed nor talked about. Online affairs have become extremely prevalent since the inception of the Internet and the proliferation of online dating, chatrooms and pornography. Some have argued that online affairs pose the biggest threat to modern marriage since women entered the work force. Fueled by what Copper called, “the Triple A engine” of “accessibility, affordability, and anonymity”, the Internet population seems to be exploring sexuality in ways that are unprecedented. Hundreds of thousands of web sites are primarily or exclusively designed to promote and financially benefit from pornography and eroticism and their frequent derivative, online affairs. Online affairs may include watching partners online on video, communication via Instant Messaging, chatrooms, simple emails or via the telephone. Online affairs can be even more disruptive than any other form of affair because it can take place any time of the day or night and often takes place in the family home. The fact that there is no actual physical contact during the sexual act often intensifies the relationship and increases its potential to be highly disruptive to the individual and the family. The frequency of this form of affair is likely to increase as the Internet grows and intrudes upon more aspects of personal and emotional lives.  Your email address will not be published.

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/what-are-the-first-symptoms-of-a-covid-19-infection/", "title": "What Are The First Symptoms Of A COVID-19 Infection?", "body": "      In early , a new virus began generating headlines all over the world because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission. Its origins have been traced to a food market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. From there, it reached countries as distant as the United States and the Philippines. The virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for infections globally, causing about as of today. The United States is the country most affected. The disease caused by contracting is called COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.  Once a person has contracted coronavirus, it can take for symptoms to appear. The average incubation period appears to be roughly . According to the , symptoms of coronavirus can be mild and come on gradually. According to , when hospital admission is necessary, this typically occurs from onwards. The states that a person with COVID-19 can experience a wide range of symptoms, often including a dry cough and shortness of breath. Based on what researchers have learned about COVID-19 thus far, the first symptoms—which generally occur within seven days can include: Usually, COVID-19 symptoms are initially mild, then become more intense over the course of about seven days. With that said, it is important to understand that COVID-19 often does not produce noticeable symptoms. When it does, however, those are classic signs that should not be ignored. Additionally, some people experience: Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, red eyes, diarrhea, or a skin rash. Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first, if you can and follow the directions of your local health authority. Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Local and national authorities and public health units are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.  The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult. Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa. While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggests that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection. Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.

The research, published in Brain Sciences, tested how open monitoring meditation — or, meditation that focuses awareness on feelings, thoughts or sensations as they unfold in one’s mind and body — altered brain activity in a way that suggests increased error recognition. “People’s interest in meditation and mindfulness is outpacing what science can prove in terms of effects and benefits,” said Jeff Lin, MSU psychology doctoral candidate and study co-author. “But it’s amazing to me that we were able to see how one session of a guided meditation can produce changes to brain activity in non-meditators.” The findings suggest that different forms of meditation can have different neurocognitive effects and Lin explained that there is little research about how open monitoring meditation impacts error recognition. “Some have you focus on a single object, commonly your breath, but open monitoring meditation is a bit different,” Lin said. “It has you tune inward and pay attention to everything going on in your mind and body. The goal is to sit quietly and pay close attention to where the mind travels without getting too caught up in the scenery.” Lin and his MSU co-authors — William Eckerle, Ling Peng and Jason Moser — recruited more than 200 participants to test how open monitoring meditation affected how people detect and respond to errors. The participants, who had never meditated before, were taken through a 20-minute open monitoring meditation exercise while the researchers measured brain activity through electroencephalography, or EEG. Then, they completed a computerized distraction test. “The EEG can measure brain activity at the millisecond level, so we got precise measures of neural activity right after mistakes compared to correct responses,” Lin said. “A certain neural signal occurs about half a second after an error called the error positivity, which is linked to conscious error recognition. We found that the strength of this signal is increased in the meditators relative to controls.” While the meditators didn’t have immediate improvements to actual task performance, the researchers’ findings offer a promising window into the potential of sustained meditation. “These findings are a strong demonstration of what just 20 minutes of meditation can do to enhance the brain’s ability to detect and pay attention to mistakes,” Moser said. “It makes us feel more confident in what mindfulness meditation might really be capable of for performance and daily functioning right there in the moment.” While meditation and mindfulness have gained mainstream interest in recent years, Lin is among a relatively small group of researchers that take a neuroscientific approach to assessing their psychological and performance effects. Looking ahead, Lin said that the next phase of research will be to include a broader group of participants, test different forms of meditation and determine whether changes in brain activity can translate to behavioral changes with more long-term practice. “It’s great to see the public’s enthusiasm for mindfulness, but there’s still plenty of work from a scientific perspective to be done to understand the benefits it can have, and equally importantly, how it actually works,” Lin said. “It’s time we start looking at it through a more rigorous lens.”     Public Health Nigeria an Interdisciplinary public health movement focused on health education, advancing fair public health policies, promoting fitness, healthy diets, responsible behavior, community health and general wellbeing.

Usually, babies undergo circumcision shortly after birth. Circumcision began as a religious rite. Today, people get circumcised for religious, medical and cultural reasons. Many baby , usually within the first week of life. Adults can get circumcised as well, though it’s less common. Circumcision is the most common surgery among males. In the United States, up to 60% of baby boys are circumcised. Around the world, the rate is about 33% of males. The highest rates of circumcision are in the U.S., Middle East and South Korea. It’s much less common in Europe, other parts of Asia and South America. Jewish and Muslim people perform circumcision as part of their religions.  As with other debates about circumcision, the effect of circumcision on female pleasure has been the subject of plenty of discussion and controversy. Fortunately, there are some pretty compelling statistics that can help you cut through the misinformation and provide you with the facts you need to make an informed decision for yourself. The of circumcised partners relates to the buildup of bacteria and other pathogens under the foreskin of an uncircumcised male. During intercourse, these pathogens can be delivered directly into the by the male partner, where they can cause infection in the vagina and urinary tract. When their male partner is circumcised, women benefit by having: A fivefold reduction in the risk of HPV-associated cervical cancer (HPV stands for human papillomavirus, a common virus that can lodge beneath the foreskin and be transmitted to the vagina and cervix during sex). A fivefold reduction in the risk of chlamydia, a serious STD that can increase the risk of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancy. A twofold decrease in the of developing genital herpes, a substantially reduced risk of developing other sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV, syphilis, and chancroid. In addition, men who are circumcised are also less likely to have smegma, a sticky residue of , oils, and other substances that can cause an unpleasant odor and become a harbor for bacteria. That can make any intimate encounter more pleasurable, including oral sex. There is also in the female partners of circumcised men. Many boys and men find it easier to maintain good genital hygiene when the foreskin is removed. But we do want to be clear here: Good hygiene is good hygiene. In general, female sex partners of uncircumcised men are at increased risk of bacterial vaginosis as they are more likely to pass along any infections they have, including yeast infections, UTIs, and STDs (particularly HPV and HIV).  Yes. People who were not circumcised as babies may choose to undergo circumcision as an adult. Generally, the procedure is the same for older boys and adults as it is for babies. They will likely have the procedure in the hospital, using anesthesia. The surgery may take slightly longer than it does for infants. They will need stitches after the circumcision, too.

The confusion stems from the inability of the presidency to disclose the nature of the president’s sickness a common practice in matured democracies and a major demand of the current government when they were in opposition. As spokesman of the Action Congress of Nigeria , Alhaji Lai Mohammed the current minister of information had lambasted the then ailing President Yar’adua for not disclosing the nature of his ailment and demanding for a daily briefing or update on the presidents condition.  The crisis assumed an international dimension on Sunday when Cable news network (CNN) an international media outlet with headquarters in Atlanta joined the debate on the whereabouts of president Buhari. In the latest edition of its program “The Global Public Square (GPS)”, aired on Sunday July 30th 2017 and anchored by its host Fareed Zakaria the news medium asked which head of state has not set foot in his homeland in over two months? The options which included Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Nigeria and Syria was a clear attempt by the news organization to draw attention to the continuous absence of the president from the country.   Owing to the confusing and debate over the nature of Buhari’s ailment and how long he will be away, Public Health Nigeria has launched an online poll to gauge the opinions of Nigerians and friends of Nigeria on the health crisis of the President.

This plant is one of the most widely cultivated plants in the world. With its high nutritive values, every part of the tree is suitable for either nutritional or commercial purposes. The leaves are rich in minerals, vitamins and other essential phytochemicals. are used to treat malnutrition, augment breast milk in lactating mothers. Moringa leaves are also used as potential antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial agent. In this article, we shall be focusing on the many benefits of this plant as well as its side effects.  The health benefits of moringa leaves include:  Moringa leaves can help fight diabetes, because it contains compounds such as isothiocyanates. High blood sugar can be a serious health problem. In fact, it’s the main characteristic of diabetes. Over time, high blood sugar levels raise the risk of many serious health problems, including heart disease. For this reason, it’s important to keep your blood sugar within healthy limits. Interestingly, several studies have shown that may help lower blood sugar levels. One showed that taking 1.5 teaspoons (7 grams) of moringa leaf powder every day for three months reduced fasting blood sugar levels by 13.5%, on average. Another small found that adding 50 grams of moringa leaves to a meal reduced the rise in blood sugar by 21%.  High cholesterol is when you have too much of a fatty substance called cholesterol in your blood. High blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol also are linked. When the arteries become hardened and narrowed with cholesterol plaque and calcium (atherosclerosis), the heart has to strain much harder to pump blood through them. As a result, blood pressure becomes abnormally high. The good news here is that have shown that Moringa has cholesterol-lowering effects.  Research has shown that is associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, and bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Yet, because chronic inflammation can continue for a long time, it’s not easy to know its exact impact. Adding moringa leaves to your food is a good way to fight inflammation and its attendant negative effects on your health. Scientists believe that the main anti-inflammatory compounds in is responsible for this effect.  Antioxidants are compounds that act against free radicals in your body. High levels of free radicals may cause , which is with chronic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The presence of increased levels of exogenous antioxidants has been shown to prevent the types of free radical damage that have been associated with cancer development. Several antioxidant have been in the leaves of . In addition to vitamin C and beta-carotene, these include:    Moringa leaf extract may also be used as a food preservative. It increases the shelf life of meat by reducing oxidation.  Research regarding the effects of moringa for increasing breast milk production is mixed. Some early research shows that moringa after one week of use, while other early research shows no benefit. It’s also not clear if moringa is beneficial when used for longer periods of time.  Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. Early research shows that taking 3 grams of moringa leaves twice daily for 3 weeks reduces the severity of asthma symptoms and improves lung function in adults with mild to moderate asthma.  The leaves of moringa is taken by mouth for “tired blood” (anemia), arthritis and other joint pain (rheumatism), diarrhea, seizures, stomach pain, stomach and intestinal ulcers, intestinal spasms, headache, heart problems, kidney stones, symptoms of menopause, thyroid disorders, and infections. Moringa leaves is also taken by mouth to reduce swelling, as an antioxidant to prevent spasms, increase sex drive (as an aphrodisiac), prevent pregnancy, boost the immune system, and increase breast milk production. Some people use it as a nutritional supplement or tonic. It is also used as a “water pill” (diuretic). Powdered moringa leaves is sometimes applied directly to the skin as a germ-killer or drying agent (astringent). It is also applied to the skin for treating pockets of infection (abscesses), athlete’s foot, dandruff, gum disease (gingivitis), snakebites, warts, and wounds.  While the leaves are perfectly safe, consuming large quantities of the bark or pulp may be harmful. Moringa side effects may include:   Moringa leaves also increased the risk of liver and kidney damage. Do not consume moringa if you are pregnant, taking the diabetes drug or taking drugs that are substrates of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes.

Commercial production of cucumbers is usually divided into two types. “Slicing cucumbers” are produced for fresh consumption. “Pickling cucumbers” are produced for eventual processing . Slicing cucumbers are usually larger and have thicker skins, while pickling cucumbers are usually smaller and have thinner skins. and phytonutrients. In terms of conventional nutrients, we are talking about a food that rises high in a food rating system with two excellents (for vitamin K and the mineral molybdenum), one very good (for the B vitamin, pantothenic acid), and 8 goods (for vitamin C, vitamin B1, and biotin in the vitamin category and for copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and potassium in the mineral category). In addition, cucumbers also contain fisetin – a flavonoid that has been of special interest to researchers not only because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties but also because of its potential for risk reduction in the case of certain cancer types. Cucumbers may in controlling and preventing diabetes. It contains substances that may help lower blood sugar or stop blood glucose from rising too high. One theory is that the cucurbitacins in cucumber help regulate insulin release and the metabolism of hepatic glycogen, a key hormone in the processing of blood sugar. Generally, this plant can help with cardiovascular system problems, type 2 diabetes, and help prevent the development of some type cancer. According to in the , cucurbitacins found in this plant may help prevent cancer by stopping cancer cells from reproducing. A of chopped cucumber with its skin also provides around 1 g of fiber. Fiber may help protect against colorectal cancer.  Cucumber is usually considered a vegetable because of how it’s used in the culinary world. However, as it grows from flowers and contains seeds, it’s botanically a fruit. According to , eating certain foods before bed can interfere with sleep due to the body’s digestive processes. They recommend avoiding foods with processed sugars just before bed, as these can cause energy levels to rise and fall quickly. Choosing fresh fruit may be a better option. They recommend eating a food rich in potassium that may prevent nighttime leg cramping. Including fruits with higher magnesium, such as plantains, apricots, or dates, can also aid in relaxation and better sleep. A cup of cucumber with its peel provides about 4 percent of your daily potassium, 3 percent of your daily fiber and 4 percent of your daily vitamin C. They also provides small amounts of magnesium. However, health experts advise against eating fruits including cucumber too close to bed time. They advise that food should be consumed at least three hours before your sleep. As far as fruits are considered there should be a gap between proper meals and fruits because both have different effect on the digestive system. Fruits get digested faster and are pushed from the stomach to the intestine much earlier. Meals which are especially rich in protein and fiber require much more time and gastric juices to digest. Therefore it is always advisable to take your cucumber early in the evening. This could be altered according to individual need.

The study, conducted by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, found that the rate of opioid deaths in the Black population increased by 38 percent between 2018 and 2019, while the death rates for other racial and ethnic groups didn’t rise. The researchers analyzed overdose data and death certificates from Kentucky, Ohio, Massachusetts and New York. Edwin Chapman, MD, an internal medicine and addiction medicine specialist who serves the Black community in Washington, D.C., told that the study “points out the fact that we have to do something different, a more intensive intervention in the African-American community.” Overdose deaths in Black communities are largely caused by fentanyl, reported. The study’s authors said the study shows the need for an antiracist public health approach to address the crisis. As at 2017, black Americans were dying from overdoses at around as white Americans were in 2014 — which even then was considered a public health crisis. According to the , the opioid epidemic is still ravaging the country as drug overdose deaths remain generally high. Nearly 841,000 people have died since 1999 from a drug overdose. In 2019, 70,630 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States. The age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths increased by over 4% from 2018 (20.7 per 100,000) to 2019 (21.6 per 100,000). According to the center;     Drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids and methamphetamine have also shifted geographically with more communities reporting fatalities.

The well loved teenager who was on high speed lost control after she clipped a Honda Civic that she was attempting to pass on the right at over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h). The Porsche crossed the road’s broad median, which lacks a physical barrier on that segment, and crashed into an unmanned concrete toll booth near the Alton Parkway interchange. The Porsche was destroyed, and Catsouras was killed on impact. Toxicological tests revealed traces of cocaine in Catsouras’ body, but no alcohol. According to News report, the Catsoura’s “incident was so shocking, the coroner wouldn’t allow individuals to identify her  body”. On the date of the accident, October 31, 2006, Catsouras and her parents ate lunch together at the family home in Ladera Ranch. After lunch, her father, Christos Catsouras, left for work while her mother remained at home. Around 10 minutes later, her mother heard a door shut along with footsteps out the back door. As she walked toward the garage, she was able to see her daughter reversing out of the driveway in her father’s Porsche 911 Carrera, a car she was not allowed to drive. Her mother called her father, who began driving around trying to find his daughter. While doing so, he called 9-1-1 for assistance, apparently minutes before the accident, and was put on hold. When he was taken off hold, the dispatcher informed him of the accident. According to the Catsouras “accident was so gruesome the coroner wouldn’t allow her parents to identify their daughter’s body”. However, photographs of the scene of Catsouras’ death were taken by California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers as part of standard fatal traffic collision procedures. These photographs were then forwarded to colleagues, and were leaked onto the Internet. Two CHP employees, Aaron Reich and Thomas O’Donnell, admitted to releasing the photographs in violation of CHP policy. O’Donnell later stated in interviews that he only sent the photos to his own e-mail account for viewing at a later time, while Reich stated that he had forwarded the pictures to four other people. Catsouras’ parents soon discovered the photographs were posted online. The pictures gained much attention, including a fake MySpace tribute website that to the photographs. People also anonymously e-mailed copies of the photos to the Catsouras family with misleading subject headers, in one case captioning the photo sent to the father with the words “Woohoo Daddy! Hey daddy, I’m still alive. “This led the Catsouras family to withdraw from Internet use and, concerned that their youngest daughter might be taunted with the photographs, to begin homeschooling her. This series of tragic and painful incident led  her family to take legal action due to the distress caused. Eventually, on January 30, 2012, the CHP reached a settlement with the Catsouras family, under which the family received around in damages. CHP spokeswoman Fran Clader commented: “No amount of money can compensate for the pain the Catsouras family has suffered. We have reached a resolution with the family to save substantial costs of continued litigation and a jury trial. It is our hope that with this legal issue resolved, the Catsouras family can receive some closure. Each year, around 3,214 teens ages 15 to 19 are killed in car accidents in the US. Young drivers between 15- and 20-years-old account for around 6.4% (13.3 million) of total drivers on the road. 11% of the drivers involved in fatal crashes were between the ages of 15 and 20. The national average car insurance payment in the United States is around $1,548 per year or $130 per month. However, personal auto insurance rate depends on several factors, including coverage type, demographics, car specifics, driving habits, age, gender, and past infractions. According to the , an average of six teenagers die from car accident injuries every single day. When a teen causes a serious vehicle crash, the outcome can be devastating for the families of everyone involved, particularly if injuries in teen car accidents are fatal.

Vaccines are designed to provide immunity without the dangers of getting the disease. It’s when receiving vaccinations. This is because your immune system is instructing your body to react in certain ways: it increases blood flow so more immune cells can circulate, and it raises your body temperature in order to kill the virus. According to reports, more than 5 million Americans have missed getting their second shot of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, reported April 25.  That translates to about 8 percent of people who got their initial shot, according to CDC data that accounted for missed second doses through April 9. Fear of side effects is among the reasons people said they were skipping their second dose. Others told the they felt they were adequately protected with one shot. Basith Syed, a 24-year-old consultant in Chicago, got his first Moderna shot in February and after spending two days feeling fatigued, going back for the second dose wasn’t a priority. “I didn’t really feel the urgency to get that second dose,” Mr. Syed told the . Earlier this month, his schedule relaxed and he went to make an appointment for the second dose, though the Walgreens he initially visited was now only administering Pfizer shots. He’s no longer actively looking for an active shot, pointing to a larger issue with mismatched pharmacy appointments. The issue of pharmacy providers scheduling second dose appointments when they don’t have the same vaccine brand in stock has affected an unknown number of customers. While some people have no issue rescheduling and pinpointing another location that has the same vaccine in stock, the hassle poses barriers for those worried about taking time off or without reliable transportation, the reported. The issues affected a “small percentage” of people who booked their appointments online and Walgreens contacted them to reschedule “in alignment with our vaccine availability,” a company spokesperson told the , adding that 95 percent of people who received their first shot at their pharmacy also got a second dose there. Health officials in some states have ramped up outreach efforts to remind people that they’re due for their shots.

The 37-year-old is now being held under the mental health act for observation and will be provided with support, this is according to newly released  statement which did not elaborate on the reasons behind the fabrication of the story. Independent Online (IOL), the media group which owns the Pretoria News that first reported the story, which alleged that Ms Sithole delivered the children on 7 June at Steve Biko Academic Hospital (SBAH) in the capital, Pretoria, saying staff were ill prepared. It accused the hospital and the provincial health authorities of trying to cover up medical negligence. The editor-in-chief of Pretoria News, Piet Rampedi, and have said the stood by their report.  Ms Sithole, who has six-year-old twins, and her partner Teboho Tsotetsi lived in Thembisa, a township with many working-class residents in Gauteng province near Johannesburg. According to IOL, they attended the same church as Rampedi where he was introduced to them in December. In May it is alleged he interviewed the couple who said they were expecting eight babies – a photoshoot shows Ms Sithole looking heavily pregnant. The birth of a surprise 10 babies was announced by Pretoria News on 8 June quoting Mr Tsotetsi as the source. He later said he had received text messages from his partner telling him about it, adding he was not allowed at the hospital because of coronavirus restrictions. Rampedi also relied on WhatsApp messages – and did not get independent confirmation from the hospital of the story. Their local mayor then confirmed the births – which is when other outlets, , published the story – but a government spokesman later said the politician only had the family’s word and no-one had yet seen the babies. Donations began flooding in for the couple and their reported babies, dubbed the “Thembisa 10”, including 1m rand ($70,000; £50,000) from IOL chairman Iqbal Survé. But the story drew suspicion after Pretoria News initially failed to disclose the hospital where the babies were born and a series of hospitals in Gauteng came out to deny their involvement. Ten days after the alleged births, IOL made the accusations against SBAH. The couple seemed to fall out in the aftermath with Mr Tsotetsi reporting her missing and asking people to stop donations a week later, while Ms Sithole accused him of wanting to benefit financially from the babies, the Pretoria News reported. Meanwhile social workers managed to track down Ms Sithole and she was admitted to hospital for tests last Friday, the Gauteng provincial authorities say.

The Principle trial is aiming to find a drug that works soon after virus symptoms appear in a patient, and one that is most effective during the primary stages of the illness, The Times reported. Other scientists said the drug had not been assessed properly and that the full extent of its efficacy was not yet known. “It has potential antiviral properties and anti-inflammatory properties and there have been quite a few smaller trials conducted in low and middle- income countries, showing that it speeds recovery, reduces inflammation and reduces hospitalization,” said Chris Butler, professor of primary care at Oxford and co-chief of the Principle trial. “But there’s a gap in the data. There’s not been a really rigorous trial.” The medicine works by blocking the entry of a protein into a cell’s nuclei, limiting the replication capacity of the virus, and initial analysis from the World Health Organization has shown promising signs. “It could save thousands of lives a day,” said Paul Marik, from the Eastern Virginia Medical School. “The data is compelling: across Mexico, India and South America, mortality has fallen.” Peter Horby, the Oxford University professor who helped to set up the UK’s largest COVID-19 trials, said this month the latest data was “interesting, perhaps encouraging, but not yet convincing.” Most breakthroughs in coronavirus treatments to date work on patients who are already suffering in the later stages of the illness, but Butler and his team are hoping to find a medicine that can prevent the virus from taking hold within its host.

Camera crews were invited to the Hospital in El Paso to capture five of its front-line workers get the coveted coronavirus vaccine . Videos on social media raised concerns among skeptical viewers who noticed that the syringe was already pushed down. “Clearly that syringe was EMPTY and the plunger was already down. Where’s the bandaid? Yeah, nice try! We are not fooled!” Facebook user Barbara Siira wrote. “Syringe is empty, the guy didn’t push the syringe at all, bad acting,” viewer Aaron Isaac Hernandez wrote. “Just for show. I’m definitely not taking this now,” wrote another Facebook user. “After numerous reports emerged on social media claiming one of the five nurses did not receive a full dose of vaccine, UMC revaccinated the nurse after confirming with the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that re-vaccinating the nurse will not cause adverse effects. The nurse returned after three weeks to receive his second dose. In a related development, Homeland Security investigators and customs officials continue to warn the public to be vigilant about potential scams involving the Covid-19 pandemic. Fraudulent schemes may include the sale of counterfeit vaccines, personal protective equipment and so-called preventative medical treatments. El Paso officials with Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement seek to identify people who may be victims of Covid-19 fraud. Federal officials anticipate that these criminals will adapt to capitalize on “overwhelming public demand for access to vaccines and treatments” as they are developed and approved. Anyone in the public who thinks they may have received a fraudulent treatment can call (915) 730-7012.

He was appointed as the Minister Health by President Muhammadu Buhari in November 2019. Following the submission of the ministerial nominees to the Senate by the Presidency in July 2019 and subsequent screening. Ehanire studied Medicine at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, qualifying as a Surgeon. He went on to the Teaching Hospital of the University of Duisburg and Essen and to the BG Accident Hospital in Duisburg, Germany for his post graduate education. In 1976, he attended the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland where he obtained a postgraduate Diploma in Anaesthetics. He got his Board Certification in both General Surgery and Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery at the Medical Board of North Rhine Westphalia in Dusseldorf, Germany. In 1984, he became a Fellow of . Dr. Osagie Ehanire worked in Germany as a Resident Anesthesiologist, Resident Vascular Surgeon and Resident General Surgeon in Thoracic Surgery at various hospitals. He also served as Clinical Instructor, Fracture Internal Fixation Course at BG Accident Hospital in Duisburg, Germany. On his return to Nigeria in 1982, he worked at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital as Senior Registrar in the Department of Surgery (Orthopaedic Surgery), a position he held until 1984. Between 1985 and 1990, he joined the Shell Petroleum Development Company Hospital as a Divisional Consultant Surgeon. He also served at various times on the Medical Review Board of Edo State Hospital Management Board and remains as a Trustee of TY Danjuma Foundation. Dr Ehanire is not new to leadership in the Nigerian health sector as he served as Nigeria’s Minister of State for Health between 2015–2019 where he forged a close working relationship with Professor Isaac Adewole, the former Minister of Health. The Minister of Health and Minister of State for Health were able to forge a collaborative working relationship during their just-concluded four-year tenure. Nigeria’s Ministry of Health has been described as one of the most complex, with well over 100 mini-parastatals, given that every tertiary health institution has its own board and management. Therefore, the opportunity of having a Minister who already understands the system, the challenges and bottlenecks is a major advantage for Dr. Ehanire’s tenure.  The Federal Ministry of Health is one of the Federal Ministries of Nigeria concerned with the formulation and implementation of policies related to health. It is headed by two Ministers appointed by the President, assisted by a Permanent Secretary, who is a career civil servant. The Ministry has several departments specializing in different aspects of health care. The Family Health department is concerned with creating awareness on Reproductive, Maternal Neonatal and Child Health, ensuring sound nutrition including infant and young child feeding, and care of the elderly and adolescents. The department of Public Health coordinates formulation, implementation and evaluation of public health policies and guidelines. It undertakes health promotion, surveillance, prevention and control of diseases. Functions of the department of Planning Research And Statistics include developing plans and budgets and monitoring their implementation, serving as Secretariat to the National Council on Health, conducting health research in collaboration with other departments and agencies, institutions and parastatals, conducting operational research and data collection, and performing various coordination functions. The department of Hospital Services supervises 53 Federal Tertiary Hospitals – Nigeria’s Teaching hospitals, Orthopedic Hospitals Federal Medical Centres and National Eye Centers. The department processes appointment of Chief Medical Directors and Medical Directors, supervises oral health research, develops policies on nursing, coordinates training programmes for nurses and monitors the midwifery service scheme in collaboration with NPHCDA. The department of Food and Drugs Services formulates national policies, guidelines and strategies on food and drugs, and ensures ethical delivery of pharmaceutical services nationwide. The department sponsors the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, and acts as regulator through the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria, the Institute of Chartered Chemists of Nigeria and the Institute of Public Analyst of Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is a federal agency under the Ministry. The agency was established in 2011 with the assistance of the US Centers for Disease Control.

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/canadian-researchers-say-gout-drug-colchicine-can-fight-covid-19/", "title": "Canadian Researchers Say Gout Drug Colchicine Can Fight COVID-19", "body": "      As the world continues the frantic search for a cure for the dreaded Coronavirus strain responsible for the current world wide pandemic, the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) has announced positive, clinically persuasive results from the COLCORONA clinical trial of orally administered drug, colchicine, for treating Covid-19. Colchicine is a medication used to treat gout and Behçet’s disease. In gout, it is less preferred to NSAIDs or steroids. Other uses for colchicine include the prevention of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever. The contact-less, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in an at-home setting in Canada, US, Europe, South America and South Africa. It analyzed whether colchicine could lower the risk of severe complications linked to Covid-19. COLCORONA had approximately 4,500 Covid-19 patients who were not hospitalized at the time of enrolment and had minimum of one risk factor for Covid-19 complications. According to the , colchicine lowered the risk of death or hospitalizations by 21% in Covid-19 patients versus placebo, approaching statistical significance. Furthermore, the analysis of the 4,159 Covid-19 patients receiving colchicine showed statistically significant reductions in the risk of death or hospitalization versus placebo. In these Covid-19 patients, the drug lowered hospitalizations by 25%, the requirement for mechanical ventilation by 50% and deaths by 44%. The Institute noted that the latest scientific discovery makes colchicine the world’s first oral drug which can be used for treating non-hospitalized Covid-19 patients. MHI Research Center Director, Université de Montréal Medicine professor and COLCORONA trial principal investigator Dr Jean-Claude Tardif said: “Our research shows the efficacy of colchicine treatment in preventing the ‘cytokine storm’ phenomenon and reducing the complications associated with Covid-19. “We are pleased to offer the first oral medication in the world whose use could have a significant impact on public health and potentially prevent Covid-19 complications for millions of patients. “Our innovative research programme also proves that the Montreal Heart Institute can make rapid scientific breakthroughs in a way that is economically viable for patients by repurposing existing drugs. Colchicine treatment can aid in alleviating hospital congestion and cut down healthcare costs, the Institute noted. Remdesivir (Veklury) is currently the only medication approved by the FDA to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The approval was based on findings that hospitalized patients who got remdesivir (Veklury) recovered faster.

Benin is bordered to the northwest by Burkina Faso, to the east by Nigeria, and to the west by Togo. The official capital is Porto-Novo, but Cotonou is Benin’s largest city, its chief port, and its de facto administrative capital. Benin was a French colony from the late 19th century until 1960. Following their inability to secure admission places in local universities and the incessant strikes that have plagued the educational system in Nigeria, many Nigerian students have sought solace in Benin Republic institutions. However, most of these institutions that Nigerian students attend in our neighboring countries are sub-standard that is why National Universities Commission, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board and the Ministry of Education had to blacklist some of these schools to save the innocent students. In many of these universities, “Nigerian students are being exploited. There is a particular country where a university is being run in the portal cabin right inside a market. Recently, the Director General of the National Youth Service Corps accused universities in the Benin Republic of presenting unqualified persons for its one-year mandatory national service.

There is a deep cultural belief in Nigeria that it is socially acceptable to hit a woman to discipline a spouse. However, over the weekend it was a man who was malevolently on the receiving end of this type of violence. Tuesday, June 30, 2020, is a day 42-year-old old Aliyu Umaru will not forget in a hurry. It was the day Halima, the first wife of Umaru, severed his manhood with a knife. He groaned in pains as he lay on a bed at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe State, where he was referred to after the incident occurred in Taraba State. Umaru said, “I’m a veterinary medicine dealer. I trade in animal drugs. I’m 42 years old with two wives and two children. The first wife had a male child and a female from the second. The first wife Halima is pregnant. I stay in Tella under Gasso LGA of Taraba State. I was transferred from the Federal Medical Centre, Taraba to the Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe.” When the Punch correspondent visited the hospital, the victim cut a pitiable sight and urethra catheter fixed to his body to pass urine as his detached manhood was kept in nylon for safekeeping. Umaru narrated the incident in a sadness-coated voice, “After I returned from work, I got water to take my bath and ate the food prepared by my wife before I slept. I was later awoken by a sharp pain and I screamed. “My wife chopped off my ‘bura’ (penis). It was then neighbours were alerted. I can’t say if my food or water was laced with anything with the way I slept deeply. My wife has finished my life and it is unfortunate.” Reports noted that Halima had been having issues with her husband and the younger wife before the incident. According to the victim’s younger brother, 40-year-old Usman, the act may not be unconnected with their mum’s plea that they should relocate which Halima didn’t support. Head of Department Accident and Emergency, Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe, Dr. Nuhu Musa, noted that the patient would get adequate medical attention. Describing his department as the entry point for first-time patients, he added that the patient had been stabilised. Nuhu stated, “A specialist has reviewed the patient and we have discussed. The patient will be moved to the theatre for operation. He is stable and being properly administered with intravenous fluid as well as other emergency drugs before the specialist came to see him.

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/sexually-transmitted-degrees-7-things-we-must-always-remember/", "title": "Sexually Transmitted Degrees : 7 Things We Must Always Remember", "body": "      The term sexually transmitted degrees refers to degrees, diplomas and certificates obtained not by academic or intellectual prowess or capacity but through granting of sexual favours in an academic setting. The term was first used by Ademule David December, 2012 and became recently popular following the undercover report by BBC which exposed some Nigerian Lecturers.  Nigerian institutions are populated by fantastic lecturers many of whom labour extremely hard under unfriendly working conditions to transfer knowledge to their students. Unfortunately, they are also packed with sexual predators and malevolent creatures destroying lives and wrecking destinies. In this piece, I have tried to capture all the issues around the sex for grades scandal with the hope that society will rise for up for what is right and make our institutions a place we can all be proud of. Our educational system has become almost useless because sex and money have become a weapon within a system that is meant to groom individuals both in character and learning. While it is true that students of tertiary institutions in Nigeria are legends of provocative dressing,  that must never be the yardstick to sexually harass and humiliate them. While not making excuses for the naked nonsense and nudity on our campuses, it must be said that if Western students , their South American counterparts and their lecturers can interact without molestation, especially in summer when the ladies wear little to nothing, Nigerian lecturers should not use this excuse. They can wield their moral powers by sending such crazy dressers out of class or their offices, instead of plotting to a sexual collabo. Sexual harassment on campuses is not one sided as many claim , ask any reasonable graduate of Nigerian University and he or she will tell you that Non Academic students who got into the system through “voodoo” means will always use ‘voodoo’ means to  secure a degree. Slay queens with nothing but ‘akamu’ in their brains are not left out, they party all night running from one club to the other while their colleagues are taking lectures. Such fellows will be off campus often for weeks spending valuable time with yahoo boys , politicians and money bags . These class of students hound lecturers for grades with offers most cannot resist and blackmailing those who resist sex or money.  When results are out they end up with an A or B, thanks to the settling schemes that has become a tradition in our institutions. The class /course representative or captain often knows more than he is ever willing to tell. Having spent more than 10 years in that role, I must assert that female students some times are the architect of their own misfortune. Many of them visit lecturers taking a course at unholy hours often alone to seek for one help or the other.  During these sessions they try to use their feminine charm to form a platonic relationship with these lecturers. However, this signal is often misinterpreted by the male lecturers as a signal for a relationship often sexual and when the other party withdraws the green light and takes off often after getting what they wanted, these lecturers feel betrayed and unleash their venom either directly or through their colleagues who are also co conspirators. See This category of persons are the ones that insist on seeing the pants of a female student or she will not graduate, no matter how brilliant she is. These group of lecturers have all the blackbook tactics used by lecturers of the underworld.  These range from giving a student who scored distinction in a course D or E simply because she refused advances  or asking a colleague to out rightly fail her. These lecturers prey on girls as young as 16, many of whom are barely the age of their children or grand children. Have you ever wondered how the exam script booklet of a student suddenly gets missing after she turned down the advances of a lecturer in another department when evidence clearly shows that she signed in and signed out of the exams and all students that took part in the exams submitted their scripts as confirmed by the examination officers? The cabal that molest students are in different departments, they know each other and share these girls among themselves. They often protect each other and go to extreme limits to ensure that they get what they want, it does not matter how many times a girl spills over. One of the most disappointing aspects of this trend as we have seen is the use of the religious organizations to cover or commit atrocities. Persons parading as pastors, imams hide under these cloaks to destroy the lives of young people leaving them scarred for the rest of their lives, forgetting that their own children will one day pass through the four walls of institutions like theirs. This practice is more prevalent in polytechnics and colleges of education where students are lured in the name of religion and transformed into sexual slaves by their demigod pastors-lecturers,  most times leaving them infected with sexually transmitted diseases.  Although this is applicable to both male and female students, it is more rampant among persons who obtained their degrees by the settling schemes in our schools. This group of people are grossly incompetent and many are either unemployable or declared incompetent by their employers after a trial period because they bypassed the necessary training and skill acquisition process during their higher institution days. At the extreme level, you will find a 2:1 graduate of English and Linguistics committing grammatical blunders and malapropisms in every sentence they utter. Some cases are so severe that  they cannot even read, write or spell simple words correctly. As a disease control specialist I have seen countless cases of HIV Carriers being raped by randy men lecturers and the so called men of God inclusive. One recurring decimal in all these cases is that a randy man on heat will not mind inserting his manhood into the mouth of a viper disguised as a female reproductive organ. Unfortunately, most of our schools have become brothels and centers for breeding criminals, yahoo boys and cultists. This piece will not be complete without celebrating the intellectual capacity of the Nigerian student. History has shown that Nigerian students especially our sisters and daughters have blazed the academic trail since independence. From America to India, from the United Kingdom to Gods own country, Nigeria, the convocation of any institution is never complete without Nigerian ladies carting away awards for academic excellence. This spirit must not be destroyed on the altar of sex, money or ego. History has shown that the Nigerian woman has contributed most when called upon for National assignment than all men combined. As a Nation, we remain eternally grateful to Professor Dora Akuyilli for saving us from menace of fake drugs , to Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh for sacrificing her life to save millions of Nigerians from Ebola, and to Ngozi Okonjo Iweala for rescuing us from the bondage of Paris Club Loan.  To every Nigerian girl out there, striving legally to earn an education and make a living, your labour will not be in vain .

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/how-montana-legalized-weed-in-2020/", "title": "How Montana Legalized Weed in 2020", "body": "      On Jan. 1, Colorado became the first state in the U.S. to allow people to legally purchase marijuana for recreational use, with Washington state to do the same later this year. Currently, allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes, making it possible that other states will follow Colorado and Washington toward greater legalization of the drug. With so many factors involved, it’s nearly impossible to predict the effects of this groundbreaking change on public health and safety, but the legalization of marijuana will likely have both positive and negative consequences. In November 2020, Montana joined , New Jersey, and South Dakota in legalizing recreational cannabis use. Montana voters , the Marijuana Legalization Initiative (“ ”) and the Allow for a Legal Age for Marijuana Amendment (“ ”), both of which needed to pass for recreational use to become legal for adults 21 and older. The ballot measures mean that the personal recreational possession and use of cannabis became legal in Montana starting on January 1, 2021. While the Montana state legislature and Department of Revenue are still developing additional rules and regulations regarding commercial licensing for dispensaries and cultivation facilities, the ballot measures are the first step toward the vast expansion of the cannabis industry in Montana, which has already had legal medical cannabis use for several years. The new laws will present new opportunities as well as important new rules for businesses to be aware of, including the forthcoming license application process, advertising rules, and impact on company drug policies.  The Montana Department of Revenue has until October 1, 2021, to establish licensing rules and regulations and to begin accepting applications for dispensaries and cultivation facilities. Under the anticipated plan, current licensed medical use dispensaries to apply for recreational licensing before the process opens up to the general public. While the Department of Revenue and state legislature will likely issue rules and guidance clarifying the licensing process and the applicable regulations, the ballot measures themselves included some provisions relevant to future cannabis business operations. For example, all advertising by licensed businesses will be prohibited, including via social media. And while businesses will be allowed to have websites, they will not be permitted to “actively solicit consumers or out-of-state consumers through the website.” Additionally, local governments will have the authority under the new law to adopt ordinances or regulations applying to any licensed commercial business within their borders, as long as those regulations are not “unduly burdensome.” Individual counties will also be able to prohibit dispensaries within their borders through a public vote. Thus, the specific rules and regulations that will apply to prospective dispensaries and cultivation centers remain uncertain.  Under the new regime, a person over the age of 21 is allowed to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, or up to eight grams of marijuana concentrate and will be allowed to grow up to four marijuana plans for personal use. However, the measures also on the public use of marijuana. For example, there is a ban on smoking or consuming marijuana products in public spaces, unless local jurisdictions designate specific places to do so and a ban on operating a vehicle while under the influence of marijuana. It remains to be seen if the legislature will consider holding establishments and persons potentially financially liable for injuries that result after they furnish marijuana to someone later involved in a driving incident while under the influence. Montana’s law, which allows such liability for those who furnish alcohol to individuals later involved in drunk driving, would need to be amended to extend to those who provide marijuana. Additionally, the new law still grants employers the right to enforce workplace drug policies. Under the state’s previous medical marijuana regime, employers were broadly permitted to require drug testing and the law explicitly stated that the legalization of medical marijuana did not prevent employers from prohibiting marijuana use, even if it was legally prescribed and used only outside of work. Indeed, that issue previously made its way to the after an employee sued his former employer for terminating him over his legal medical marijuana use. The employee used medical marijuana, off-duty, to treat a chronic condition, but was fired when a drug-test revealed THC in his system. The court agreed with the employer that the exemption in the Medical Marijuana Act allowed it to dismiss the employee and that the provision did not present any constitutional concerns. The new law for recreational use includes the same provision allowing employers to prohibit marijuana use. Therefore, employers will continue to be free to enforce their workplace drug policies. This will include, presumably, the right to discipline and terminate employees for legal recreational cannabis use, regardless of whether it is done on or off-duty. The new rules establish a 20 percent tax on sales of recreational marijuana by licensed vendors and specify that 10 percent of that revenue will go into the general state fund, with the remainder “dedicated to accounts for conservation programs, substance abuse treatment, veterans’ services, health care costs, and localities where marijuana is sold.” The proponents and authors of the measures estimated that legalization will generate about annually in tax revenue and licensing fees by 2025. The success of ballot initiatives in Montana and in other states are major victories for legalization activists and present enormous opportunities for businesses and the already expanding cannabis industry. However, in Montana at least, legalization still faces an uncertain future. Several state legislators have already announced that they to repeal the measure, and the Montana Department of Revenue’s forthcoming rules for licensing will likely face extensive challenges from opposition group. Fewer people may buy cannabis when they understand the risk to their employment. As of now, though, by this fall businesses will begin applying to enter the Montana cannabis industry.

{"link": "https://www.publichealth.com.ng/list-of-third-world-countries/", "title": "Updated List Of Third World Countries 2019/2020", "body": "      The phrase ‘Third World Countries’ originated in 1952 during the time of the Cold War. Alfred Sauvy, a French economic historian, coined the phrase, the term Third World referred to the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the nations not aligned with either the First World or the Second World.This usage has become relatively rare due to the ending of the Cold War. In the decade following the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the term Third World was used interchangeably with developing countries, but the concept has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world. Strictly speaking, “Third World” was a political, rather than an economic, grouping.Since about the 2000s the term Third World has been used less and less. It is being replaced with terms such as developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South.  Third World countries are besieged with numerous issues that are acting as barriers in their development. Today, the term is referred to nations, which are poor and underdeveloped. Almost all of the Third World countries are grappling with the problems of poverty, scarcity of water and electricity, poor infrastructure, low educational standards and healthcare problems. is one of the biggest challenges that the Third World Countries are grappling with. It has been estimated that around 1.3 billion people who are living in Third World Countries live on an income of less that $1.50 per day which makes it really hard to live a decent life. Poverty has a devastating effect on the person as well as the nation. , which is a common feature of these nations. Clean drinking water is a basic necessity, but in a majority of these countries a significant part of the population does not have access to clean drinking water. Poor quality of roads, highways and other infrastructure have prevented these nations from joining the ranks of developed countries. Education is another fundamental right that is not available to many people in these countries. . The lack of education hampers the overall development of the children. Often these children are employed in hazardous jobs which put their health and lives at risk.There are many other problems affecting Third World Countries such as corruption, poor governance, lack of electricity, too much dependence on foreign debt etc. The Third World countries are plagued by various problems, but the one that is most affecting these nations and is hindering their social and economic progress is poor educational infrastructure and high school drop out rate. According to a report by the UNESCO, twenty percent of people in these Third World nations are unable to make it past the primary school. To make matters worse, these people also lack skills for work, which make it extremely tough for them to get employment. The UNESCO report paints a dismal picture of the state of education in these nations. There are some 250 million children in Third World nations who are of primary school age and still are unable to read or write. Approximately 71 million teenagers have dropped out of secondary school. As they do not have the required skills for future employment, these teenagers are unable to get jobs. There are manifold reasons for the dismal education system in these nations and may range from poverty to being born a female. Poverty is one of the biggest challenges that come in the way of children. Poor families are unable to afford the fees and hence find it tough to send their children to school. Even those who do get a chance to go to school drop out midway as poverty forces these children to work and help their families. In some countries, girl students opt out of education due to lack of separate toilets for females. Poor nations, especially those torn by conflicts and wars, are unable to spend a part of their GDP on education. Some other factors that act as the hindrance in students attaining education in Third World nations are lack of trained teachers, classrooms, and learning materials, countries plagued by violence and civil wars, long distance between the school and the student’s home, poverty, or simply belonging to the female gender.The list of 3 world countries include : .

According to residents, on arrival at the hospital, one of the victims who was among the first to be rushed to the hospital, gave up the ghost. The residents also told ThisDay which visited the affected communities on Tuesday, that the remaining 49 persons died in their various houses while receiving traditional medicine from herbalists. The village head of Kogware community, Shu’aibu Iliyasu, who also confirmed the development, said 50 persons had so far died as a result of the strange disease within the community. But the state government said 45 cases of the strange illness were recorded with 18 dead. Iliyasu said: “We are still shocked over this unforseen circumstances that led to the death of our people. In this community alone, 50 people including children have died of this strange disease. “There are reported cases of death also in Ungwan Sarka but I don’t know the exact figure because the place is not under my jurisdiction,” the traditional ruler said. The paramount ruler added that he reported the scenario to the local government council and injections and drips were given to the victims by the medical personnel in the area but the situation persisted, hence the need for speedy action by the state government. According to him, “We therefore, call on the state government as a matter of urgency to come to our aid by providing the needed medical attention and investigate the root cause of this strange disease and take precautionary measures to end the untimely death of my people.” Another resident, Kabir Garba Sarka, said many people died of the same illness at Ungwan Sarka and over 800 people were hospitalized in different hospitals in the area. However, when contacted, the Executive Secretary of Katsina State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr. Shamsudeen Yahaya, said only 18 people died of the strange illness as investigation was ongoing to unravel the disease. “We have 45 cases of that suspected illness. Out of it, we have 18 dead. And out of the 11 samples we collected, five are negative, while the remaining six we are waiting for the result because we have taken the samples to Lagos. “People could have died of any other thing but for this one, that is the figure. It is a suspected case. We can only believe it when we have laboratory confirmation,” he said. It could be recall that the Katsina State government had of recent immunized over six million people against yellow fever when the deadly disease broke out in Dan-Musa Local Government area of the state.

Most times when people think health issues in Africa, people think of chronic hunger, or infectious diseases such as malaria or HIV/AIDS. But Africa is simultaneously struggling with an increase in noncommunicable diseases, most of them related to obesity. According to a FIFA 2018 World Cup Scorecard on Obesity conducted among the 32 countries participating in the World Cup finals, Nigeria  ranks among countries with lower obesity prevalence but has the highest rates of growth in overweight and obese adults.  A study published in the Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice reported that Obesity, and overweight were found in 17% and 31%, of participants respectively.  It noted that  while underweight  declined with increasing age, overweight, and obesity increased to peak in the middle age brackets. Age of ≥ 40 years was found to confer about twice the risk of becoming overweight. The prevalence of obesity and mean BMI were significantly higher both among the females and the participants from southern zones. Another study concluded that the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals in Nigeria is of epidemic proportions.  According to a Kenyan government survey more than 40 percent of women aged 30 to 40 are overweight or obese.  According to the , noncommunicable diseases (or NCD for short) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71 percent of all deaths globally. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, followed by cancer, respiratory diseases and diabetes. Many of the risk factors — tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets — are particularly prominent in parts of Africa. in many African countries have at least three of these four risk factors. Most of these adults are women aged 45 to 64. READ One of the main causes are dietary habits that include too many refined carbohydrates, oils and sugars that have come with the proliferation of convenience foods. In addition, there is a traditional belief that excess weight is a symbol of prosperity and wealth. Often obese people are unaware of the risks until told by doctors, and most of them say they wish they had known about it earlier. Your email address will not be published.

Around 21.7 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. There are five major types of ART’s used in this regard this includes: These are drugs that interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itself. These are drugs that interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particles These are drugs that block the virus from entering the body’s cells These are drugs that block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself These are drugs that contain two or more different types of medication that prevents the multiplication of the virus in the body. These medicines help people with HIV, but they do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing, even when they are taking these  medicines. In March this year, stated that it was  greatly encouraged by the news that an HIV-positive man has been functionally cured of HIV. The man was treated by specialists at University College London and Imperial College London for advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2016 using stem cell transplants from a donor who carried a rare genetic mutation. Researchers report that HIV has been undetectable in the man since he stopped taking antiretroviral medicine 18 months ago. A cure for HIV is  the total eradication of the virus from the body.  Here are some of the strategies scientists and medical researchers are looking into for an effective cure for  HIV: Current strategies and in the development of a functional cure for HIV-1, focusing on full/partial replacement of the immune system, ‘shock and kill’, and ‘permanent silencing’ approaches. These new treatments to eradicate HIV-1 are focused on the activation of viral production from latently infected cells to purge and clear HIV-1 reservoirs. This strategy involves the use of a wide range of small molecules called latency-reversing agents (LRAs). HIV hides in reservoir cells in the body and can remain silent as long as a patient takes antiretroviral therapy. As soon as a patient stops taking ARTs, the reservoir virus wakes up and starts replicating all around the body again. Shock and Kill would ‘wake up’ these reservoirs to activate the silent virus. Whilst counter-intuitive, the idea is to wake up every single virus and kill all the activated cells, destroying the reservoir in one go. If one virus survives then there is always a risk that it will be able to duplicate and the virus will return. Currently, scientists have identified drugs that will ‘shock’ or ‘wake up’ the silent reservoir cells. The next challenge is to identify a drug or method that can subsequently destroy these infected cells and avoid healthy cells. When destroying cells in the body, there is always a risk that drugs will target healthy cells, so this research moves carefully to avoid unnecessary damage. indicate that Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as givinostat, belinostat and panobinostat, and class I-selective HDACis that include oxamflatin, NCH-51 and romidepsin, are the most advanced in clinical testing for HIV-1LRAs The ‘Lock and Block’ technique takes the opposite approach to ‘Shock and Kill’. This method aims to trap HIV in its reservoir cell so that it can never be reactivated. Whilst the virus is still present in the body, it is trapped away so that it cannot escape its host cell and cannot replicated. This technique is being looked into as an alternative to ‘Shock and Kill’. How Lock and Block Mechanism Works Since HIV integrates into the host genome, it can persist for life in a latent reservoir. HIV integrase (IN) uses the host co-factor LEDGF/p75 to target integration towards transcription units. LEDGINs, a new class of antivirals, block the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction and allosterically inhibit IN (early effect). They also cause maturation defects and aberrant progeny virus. Scientists are currently abilities to effectively trap HIV in a host cell without disrupting the genetic material of uninfected cells. Ideally, a drug would lock HIV away then deplete the reservoir so there was no possibility of the virus returning. Current issues that are being researched are drugs not locking away HIV tightly enough. A stem cell transplant replaces stem cells. It is used when stem cells or bone marrow have been damaged or destroyed by disease, including some types of cancer, or by high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to treat cancer.Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue inside your large bones. The bone marrow’s main job is to make blood cells that flow through the body. Stem cells are the most basic cells in the bone marrow, and they develop into different types of blood cells. There are 2 major types of stem cell transplant – allogeneic and autologous. In an allogeneic stem cell transplant, stem cells are removed from another person (a donor) and given to you (the recipient). In an autologous stem cell transplant, you provide your own stem cells. If you receive stem cells from your identical twin, this is called a syngeneic transplant.Only one man has ever been ‘cured’ of HIV. , otherwise known as the ‘Berlin patient’, was cured of HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant for another condition. Due to a rare genetic mutation in the donated stem cells, Brown’s immune system could fight off the HIV in his body. Over a decade later, he is still HIV-free and actively campaigning for HIV research and speaking about his experience. Brown was diagnosed with HIV in 1995 while studying in Berlin, Germany. In 2007 he underwent a procedure known as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat leukemia (performed by a team of doctors in Berlin, Germany, including Gero Hütter). From 60 matching donors, they selected a [CCR5]-Δ32 homozygous individual with two genetic copies of a rare variant of a cell surface receptor. This genetic trait confers resistance to HIV infection by blocking attachment of HIV to the cell. Roughly 10% of people of European or Western Asian ancestry have this inherited mutation, but it is rarer in other populations. Most people have the gene called CCR5 in their DNA. This produces a receptor on human cells that HIV can ‘latch onto’ and thus infiltrate the cell barrier. However, this donor had the mutation called CCR5 – delta32 which produces a receptor that HIV is unable to interact with. The virus can no longer invade human cells and the human host is resistant to HIV. When Brown received the stem cells with this CCR5 – delta32 mutation, his body DNA adapted and he became resistant to HIV. However, the details behind why Brown was cured of HIV are complex and difficult to repeat. Even repeating the procedure in other patients, their HIV has come back after a period in remission. There are still elements that scientists don’t understand enough to reproduce the results in other HIV-positive patients. Additionally, stem cell transplants are dangerous, expensive and require very specific donors otherwise the body can reject the new cells. Stem cell transplantation probably won’t become a mainstream avenue for an HIV cure. Two hundred years after the discovery of vaccine by the English physician Edward Jenner, immunization can be credited with saving approximately 9 million lives a year worldwide. A further 16 million deaths a year could be prevented if effective vaccines were deployed against all potentially vaccine-preventable diseases. HIV Vaccine Awareness Day is observed each year to raise awareness and recognize the many volunteers, community members, health professionals, and scientists working to develop a vaccine to prevent HIV. It is also an opportunity to educate communities about the importance of preventive HIV vaccine research. A safe and effective preventive HIV vaccine is key to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic.HIV research also includes efforts to develop a vaccine for HIV treatment (called a therapeutic vaccine). A safe and effective therapeutic HIV vaccine could prevent HIV from advancing to AIDS, replace daily use of HIV medicines, and help eliminate HIV from the body. Many HIV vaccines have been trialed and only one has had significant results. It is called the RV144 trial which started in 2003, in Thailand. A cohort received a and were tested for HIV three years later. From the volunteers, the rate of HIV was 31% lower in the cohort who received the vaccine compared to those who received the placebo.This study gave scientists hope that there could be a possibility for a vaccine. However, the strain of HIV found in Thailand is different to the strain found in sub-Saharan Africa, so the vaccine prototype needs to be adjusted the strains of the virus that are most common in South Africa.There are projects to create a vaccination however, it is complicated to create a lasting vaccination. Researchers at the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, an HIV vaccine trial, HVTN 702. This trial, which began in 2016, is predicted to run for five years. HIV-negative, South African adults receive a series of injections at five different time points that rally the body’s defenses against HIV. If successful, this could be the biggest step towards a vaccine and we are closer than we have ever been.Some trial work has been done to create infusions that give participants protection, but the protection only lasts for a month or so before another dose is needed. Many diseases in the past have been , thanks to vaccinations: polio, mumps, smallpox, tetanus and measles to name a few. ART reduces the amount of virus (or viral load) in your blood and body fluids. ART is recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of how long they’ve had the virus or how healthy they are. ART also reduces your chance of transmitting HIV to others if taken as prescribed. Studies has shown that treating the virus within the first 48 hours of exposure can significantly reduce the size of the HIV reservoir hidden in the body. A unique concluded that early HIV diagnosis and early antiretroviral therapy reduced early infant mortality by 76% and HIV progression by 75%. This method is suitable for certain people (e.g. new born babies of HIV-positive mothers), but will not work for everyone.However, many people do not get access to HIV treatment early enough and many people do not realize they have HIV until months after they are first exposed. This is another reason why it is important to go for an HIV test regularly so that you always know your status and can act quickly if you do become infected. The use of herbal medicine is increasingly becoming more popular in many countries. This practice has continued to be a main source of health care in the rural communities especially in developing countries, since modern medicine has not been able to solve the HIV question many are embracing herbal cure. HIV‐infected people and AIDS patients often seek complementary therapies including herbal medicines due to reasons such as unsatisfactory effects, high cost, non‐availability, or adverse effects of conventional medicines.  Nine randomized placebo‐controlled trials involving 499 individuals with HIV infection and AIDS showed that a preparation called SPV30 may be helpful in delaying the progression of HIV disease in HIV‐infected people who do not have any symptoms of this infection. A Chinese herbal medicine, IGM‐1, seems to improve the quality of life in HIV‐infected people who do have symptoms. Another herbal compound ,SH, showed an increase of antiviral benefit when combined with antiretroviral agents while a South American herb preparation, SP‐303, may reduce the frequency of abnormal stools in AIDS patients with diarrhoea. The search for a has reached advanced stage, a pilot study conducted in the country to determine the effectiveness (clinical and laboratory responses) of α-Zam a combination of  Nigella sativa and honey showed very promising results for HIV management.

As I read through his  Chevron Netherlands acquisition dairy, I pictured a young Nigerian that exemplifies the true Nigerian spirit  of never giving up, a young Nigerian  transforming his education, training, and contacts into an idea that would have revolutionized the way oil and gas business is conducted on the continent. Going through his write up to me was  like attending Harvard Business school through the back door, the whole business concept of Catalan, and the openness with which he described his failures and willingness to accept responsibilities for them  makes  the chronicles of Catalan a good read for African businessmen and women with interest in becoming big players in the Oil and gas sector on the continent with one of the largest proven oil and gas reserves in the world. 1. Unlike many rich kids and heir to riches,  Paddy had the courage to strike out on his own and build a business that was bigger than anything he has ever attempted. All rich kids are not the same ; the fact that he/ she is from a rich home  does not mean he/she is not intelligent, ambitious or hardworking. 2. Although born with a silver spoon, here was a golden boy, uncomfortable with sitting back and getting a golden pass through life. He swapped the largest Indigenous mobile telecommunications operator  with a five man   start up to pursue his dreams. Riches does not necessarily make you fulfilled 3. He was willing to venture and travel into unfamiliar territories outside his comfort zone in search of new opportunities instead of “feasting” on his fathers empire. There are certain things you will never learn in your comfort zone 4. The Edgar and Remi component of the memoir showed that experience and relationships still matters a lot in business, and  that although he has managed companies at the highest levels,   he was not immune to making bid wrecking and business crumbling mistakes. Lesson: You may never get help if you refuse to ask. 5. The Catalan Management advice against his guts is a reminder to business tycoons and entrepreneurs that sometimes its  pays to trust your instincts. Lesson: It takes more than best brains to succeed in business. As an avid reader and author, I have chosen to share this few but powerful lessons  I have learnt from Paddy’s chronicles  praying that perhaps , Nigerians who hate long reads like me sometime ago will somehow learn from a Nigerian who has chosen to share his memoir with us with the hope that we will learn from the  mistakes of his near acquisition of Chevron Netherlands  and just like his father  we will one day share in his joy and accomplishments.
