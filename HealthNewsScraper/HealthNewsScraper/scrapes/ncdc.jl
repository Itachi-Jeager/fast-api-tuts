This was following the appointment of Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, the outgoing NCDC Director General, as Assistant Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) to head its new pandemic intelligence hub in Berlin from 1st November 2021. The official handover ceremony held on 18th October 2021 and was declared open by the Honourable Minister of Health– Dr Osagie Ehanire. The ceremony was also an opportunity to celebrate the remarkable transformation journey of NCDC in implementing it’s 5-year strategic plan for national health security in line with its mandate to lead the preparedness, detection, and response to public health emergencies. Under the leadership of Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu since 15th of August 2016, the agency has witnessed transformational growth from a young parastatal to a science-based institution leading the public health response to the largest pandemic in recent history under the Federal Ministry of Health. Despite the general pessimism at the ability of public institutions to deliver on their mandate, Dr. Ihekweazu’s vision was to build the confidence of Nigerians in the NCDC as the body established to protect the health of citizens. His visionary leadership at NCDC enabled the establishment of strategic partnerships and exponential investment in research, infrastructure, and human capital development critical to strengthen Nigeria’s health security. After five years of leading the NCDC, Dr Ihekweazu spoke on his handover to Dr Adetifa: “During this time of transformation, there is no better person to lead our young agency,” said Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, NCDC’s first Director General. “Dr Adetifa is a proven leader with strong epidemiology, academic and research background as well as the ability to bring people together. His vision for effective utilisation of scientific-evidence to prevent, detect and respond to public health emergencies is exactly what NCDC needs build on the gains achieved so far.” The incoming DG, Dr Ifedayo Adetifa is a Clinical Epidemiologist with a strong public health and research background. Prior to his appointment, he was an Associate Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Dr Adetifa received his undergraduate medical training at the University of Ilorin and completed his residency training in paediatrics at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. He holds an MSc in Epidemiology from LSHTM and a Ph.D. in Epidemiology from the University of Amsterdam. Read more about Dr Adetifa’s work here. While accepting the baton of leadership from the outgoing NCDC Director General, Dr Adetifa spoke on his plans for the future with NCDC: “I must congratulate Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu and the NCDC Team for the incredible work they have done so far, for Chikwe’s exemplary leadership, and for the smooth transition process. For several years now, I have closely followed the activities of the agency without any inkling that I would ever be the one to lead it. My focus in the next few weeks is to work with colleagues and partners to understand their work better so we can collectively build on the gains made so far, in line with the NCDC mandate.” The handover ceremony was also an opportunity to reflect on NCDC’s contribution to health security and nation building. Attendees included representatives of the National Assembly, heads of government institutions, Country Heads of United Nations Agencies, members of the diplomatic corps, other health security partners including the private sector. They shared their experience working with the NCDC and reiterated commitment to sustaining collaborative efforts with the incoming Director General to achieve the NCDC mandate.

The risk of spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 is higher in confined spaces where there is close contact (less than 2 metres), with an infected, but possibly asymptomatic person, the riskier the longer someone has close contact with an infected person. This highlights the importance of ensuring strict and continued adherence to public measures in workplaces and business premises. Employers and business owners have a responsibility to stay abreast of guidelines and recommendations from NCDC, to protect their staff, visitors and customers. The following guidelines are provided to employers and business owners, to safeguard the health and safety of employees and customers; 1.Temperature checks must be carried out on all employees and customers entering office and business premises (any person with a temperature 38 degrees Celsius or above, should be denied entry and advised to go for a health check). 2.No mask, No entry, No service - all staff members, visitors and customers entering workplaces, shops or business premises must wear a face mask that should cover the mouth and nose at all times, and should not remove them, especially if speaking to another person in close proximity. 3.All office and business premises must have a handwashing station with running water and soap or hand sanitizer at the entrance. Employers and business owners have a responsibility to ensure hand sanitizers are always refilled and soap and water always available. 4.Restrict all physical meetings and instead opt for virtual meetings, whenever possible. If physical meetings must be held, ensure there is adequate ventilation of the room, limit the number of attendees and ensure all staff members wear face masks, maintain physical distance of at least two metres and adhere to other public health measures. 5.Business owners, leaders in public service have a responsibility to ensure that all staff members abide by the mandated public health measures, including maintaining physical distance, wearing of face masks at all times. 6.Limit the number of people seated in an office, ensuring there is adequate space to allow for reasonable physical distancing. Business owners should limit the number customers entering and being served in their shops or premises, at one time. 7.Office, shops and business premises must be well-ventilated and cleaned regularly throughout the day, ensuring that frequently touched surfaces like desks, countertops, work stations, railings, door handles, are cleaned and disinfected. An occupational health and infectious diseases preparedness plan must be place, in case an employee, customer or visitor becomes unwell. 8.Ensure there is clear and visible signage in offices and business premises, reminding employees and customers to adhere to public health measures, e.g. maintaining physical distance, wearing face masks over nose and mouth, and hand hygiene 9.Every office, shop or business premise should appoint \"compliance champions\", to monitor, remind and reinforce adherence to these public health measures. 10.Employees who are feeling unwell or have COVID-19 symptoms, should notify their supervisor immediately, or stay at home and seek medical attention to confirm diagnosis, by doing a COVID19 test. The continued spread of COVID-19 continues to put increased pressure on our already fragile health systems and threaten Nigeria's economy. Public sector leaders and business owners have to play their own part, by taking responsible and decisive action to help stop the spread and upsurge of COVID-19 in the country, ensuring adherence to public health measures and guidelines provided in this advisory.

This public health advisory provides an update on the current situation, response activities and recommends measures to reduce the risk of spread in our country. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION As of the 10th of December 2020, just over 71,000 confirmed cases and 1,190 deaths have been reported across 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Since the beginning of September to the end of November 2020, Nigeria has recorded a gradual increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country. However, in the last week (30th of November to the 6th of December) our surveillance system has recorded a sharp increase in cases. The average number of daily cases recorded in the last week was higher than was recorded between September – November. SITUATION ACROSS STATES The COVID-19 situation continues to differ across states. While there has been an increase in the number of cases across 23 states in the country, majority (73%) of the cases detected were from Lagos, Kaduna and the Federal Capital Territory. Eight of the 23 states with an increase in the number of cases, reported a record high number of weekly cases last week. TESTING ACROSS STATES There has been an increase in the number of tests carried out nationwide in the last five weeks. It is important to note that in the last week, the proportion of people who have tested positive among those tested, increased from 3.9% to 6.0% when compared to the previous week. However, in the last week, there has been a decline in the rate of testing across 12 states. These are Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger, Yobe, Borno, Gombe, Bauchi, Plateau, Taraba, Nasarawa, Benue and Anambra. The NCDC will continue to work with all states to scale up both demand for and access to COVID-19 testing. Given the epidemiology of the virus, the increase in cross country travel, and poor testing rates, none of these states can report to have full control over the pandemic yet. RESPONSE ACTIVTIES Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 which includes NCDC, as well as state governments have continued to scale up response activities. NCDC has supported all states in Nigeria to activate at least one public health laboratory for COVID-19 diagnosis. Testing for public health purposes remains free of charge. A list of sample collection centres across states can be found on www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng The NCDC through the World Bank REDISSE Fund has also supported each state with 100 million naira, for the implementation of the state COVID-19 Incident Action Plan. Through support from the Africa Centers for Disease Control (ACDC), NCDC deployed epidemiologists to support response activities in states, and community volunteers in Local Government Areas (LGAs). Across the country, NCDC has continued to provide laboratory and medical supplies for continuity of testing and case management. In addition, NCDC is working with other government stakeholders to scale up risk communications in all states. As part of the measures to reduce the risk of an increase in cases associated with international travel, the PTF-COVID-19 instituted measures that are enforced through a travel protocol. Through these measures, we have mitigated to some extent the impact of travel on the epidemic in Nigeria. However, the advice for now is to avoid non-essential travel altogether. ADVICE TO NIGERIANS The number of new COVID-19 cases is increasing across the country, now is not the time to let our guard down. We remind all Nigerians to adhere to the following important public health measures: 1.Limit all non-essential domestic and international travel. This is especially important for intending travellers from countries recording a high number of COVID-19 cases. If you must travel to Nigeria, please adhere to the seven-day isolation period and post-arrival test 2.Always wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth when in public settings, such as marketplace, office, schools, religious settings etc 3.Maintain physical distance of at least 2 metres from others in public settings 4.Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer when hands are not visibly dirty and running water is not readily available 5.Avoid direct contact with people such as hugging and handshaking 6.Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper, or your elbow when sneezing and/or coughing. Dispose of the tissue properly immediately after use and wash your hands. 7.Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness 8.Stay at home if you feel unwell and call your state helpline. Do not mingle with others if you have symptoms such as fever, cough or sudden loss of sense of taste or smell 9.Public settings including religious settings, businesses, markets should ensure adherence to public health and safety measures 10.Vulnerable groups i.e. people 60 and above and/or people with pre-existing medical conditions should avoid non-essential outings and visitors. Where possible, have a friend or family member bring you supplies. See NCDC advisory for more information- https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/media/files/AdvisoryforVulnerableGroupsV2June2020.pdf Further information on where to get tested for COVID-19 can be found via www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng.

This occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites resist the effects of medicines or antimicrobials, making common infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. As part of efforts to combat this threat, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) joins the global community to commemorate the 2020 World Antibiotics Awareness Week (WAAW). In 2015, the World Health Organization set aside the month of November to raise awareness on antimicrobial resistance. Since 2017, NCDC as the National AMR Coordinating body has worked closely with states, relevant stakeholders in the Ministries of Health, Agriculture and Environment to strengthen surveillance for AMR and raise awareness on this public health threat. This year, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, in collaboration with Ministries, Departments and Agencies in the animal and human health sectors with support from partners will commemorate the WAAW from 18-24 November themed ‘’Antimicrobials: Handle with care’’. The goal is to raise awareness on the global threat of AMR and promote responsible antimicrobial usage amongst healthcare professionals in the animal, human and environment sectors as well as the public. Several activities have been outlined by NCDC, Federal Ministries of Agriculture and Environment in collaboration with partners, to be held at both national and state level. These include: 1.Webinar on operationalising One Health interventions on antimicrobial stewardship in Nigeria 2.Participation at the international webinar on antimicrobial resistance awareness organised by Shoolini University, India 3.Virtual engagement with livestock farmers 4.Interactive discussion with Honourable Commissioners of Health, Agriculture and Environment 5.Training with Fleming Fund Fellows on Antimicrobial resistance and Antimicrobial use surveillance 6.Interactive discussion with State Epidemiologists, State Veterinary Epidemiology officers and State Environmental officers 7.Virtual meeting to establish Community of Practice for AMR 8.Training of journalists on AMR awareness In the last four years, Nigeria has achieved significant milestones in improving AMR surveillance and increasing awareness on the threats. This includes constitution of a National Antimicrobial Resistance Coordination Committee (NARCC) and Technical Working Group (TWG), a functional surveillance network with sentinel sites and reference laboratories in the human and animal sector, conduct of a Situation Analysis and development of a National Action Plan. In addition, the NCDC National Reference Laboratory and other laboratories within the national network are enrolled in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS). Through this and other systems in place, Nigeria is contributing to the global response to AMR. Antimicrobial Resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across various government sectors and society. We urge Nigerians to avoid the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials. It is also important to avoid the heavy use of antibiotics in food animal production. The National AMR secretariat at NCDC continues to play a vital role in connecting relevant stakeholders to implement the National Action Plan on AMR. About the NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is the country’s national public health institute, with the mandate to lead the preparedness, detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies.

This is part of the #TakeResponsibility campaign which began in February 2020 and focuses specifically on measures Nigerians need to take to protect themselves and loved ones during the Christmas and New Year period. In the last two weeks, there has been a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases across the country. On the 17th of December, a record daily number of 1,145 new confirmed cases was recorded. This increase is as a result of a convergence of circumstances which includes increased local and international travels, business and religious activities with minimal compliance with COVID-19 safety measures by the members of the public. As at 21st December 2020, a total of 78,790 cases and 1,227 deaths have been recorded in Nigeria across all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with over 70 million cases reported globally. The enforcement of adherence to the safety measures is not only the sole responsibility of the government. Individuals and institutions have a responsibility too and need to play their part in ensuring adherence to the preventive measures. The Federal Government of Nigeria, through the PTF-COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Information and Health as well as NCDC and its partners are therefore intensifying risk and crisis communication efforts to remind all of us about our collective responsibility. Critically, Nigerians are being urged to adhere to recommended measures by NCDC and other public health authorities, as they celebrate Christmas and New Year. Please avoid all non-essential travel within and outside Nigeria to reduce the risk of transmission. The virus that causes COVID-19 is more likely to spread in mass gatherings especially when held indoors. We advise that people avoid mass gatherings during this time, or hold them outdoors with physical distancing, compulsory use of facemasks and provision of handwashing facilities or hand sanitizer. The campaign titled ‘Celebrate Responsibly’ is being implemented with the Federal Ministry of Information and other Government Institutions and partners involved in the COVID-19 response. It emphasises the responsibility of Nigerians, the government, private sector, institutions, associations, communities and individuals in implementing and adhering to the COVID-19 prevention and response measures. The campaign is specifically focused on the next four weeks, which includes the Christmas, New Year holiday and start of the new year, as there is a need to reinforce to Nigerians that now is not the time to let down our guard. COVID-19 has continued to threaten lives and livelihoods and we must take all precautions necessary. It will include the production of audio and visual materials which have been translated to local languages, for wide dissemination. The NCDC urges all individuals, traditional and religious leaders, business owners, the media and other institutions to join the campaign. The “Celebrate Responsibly” campaign calls on all Nigerians to take all necessary precautions for a safe and healthy Christmas celebration. To download materials for the campaign, please visit www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng or contact  The NCDC remains grateful to all frontline health workers, state public health teams, stakeholders and partners, including the media who have continued to work extremely hard since the beginning of this year supporting the response efforts.

Across the world, Christmas is a time for celebration and festive cheer, as well as an increase in religious and social gatherings. During the Christmas and New Year celebrations, we recognise that people want to travel and be with family and friends. However, this has been a difficult year and the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our usual way of living and we all have to make adjustments in our lives to the new reality we are faced with. We must all continue to take the necessary measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Nigeria, just over 67,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported with just over 1,000 deaths. Most of the confirmed cases and deaths have been in urban/semi-urban cities and town and the risk of spread remains. The COVID-19 virus does not spread on its own, it spreads when people move around. This means that by traveling across countries and cities, there is a higher risk of transmission, especially to rural areas where the existing health infrastructure is already weak. Nigerians are therefore advised to be vigilant, this is not the time to let our guard time. It is therefore advisable to: 1.Limit all non-essential domestic and international travel. This is especially important for intending travellers from countries recording a high number of COVID-19 cases. As an alternative to travel, the following should be considered: •Limit festivities to members of your immediate household. While remaining physically distanced, remain socially connected with friends and loved ones using mobile or video conferencing technology. •Hold virtual services and prayer sessions to limit mass congregation. •Limit person-to-person contact and physical movement using electronic money transfers systems. 2.Always wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth when in public settings, such as religious centres and market places 3.Maintain physical distance of at least 2 metres from others in public settings 4.Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer when hands are not visibly dirty and running water is not readily available 5.Avoid direct contact with people such as hugging and handshaking 6.Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper, or your elbow when sneezing and/or coughing. Dispose of the tissue properly immediately after use and wash your hands. 7.Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness 8.Stay at home if you feel unwell and call your state helpline. Do not mingle with others if you have symptoms such as fever, cough or sudden loss of sense of taste or smell 9.Public settings including religious settings, businesses, markets should ensure adherence to public health and safety measures 10.Vulnerable groups i.e. people 60 and above and/or people with pre-existing medical conditions should avoid non-essential outings and visitors. Where possible, have a friend or family member bring you supplies. See NCDC advisory for more information - https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/media/files/AdvisoryforVulnerableGroupsV2June2020.pdf The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to rise across several countries globally. If you must travel to Nigeria during this period, please ensure strict adherence to the following travel protocols issued by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19: 1.Passengers MUST test negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from their country of exit 120 hours before departure and preferably within 72 hours pre-boarding. 2.All intending passengers are required to register on the Nigeria International Travel Portal (NITP) via – http://nitp.ncdc.gov.ng, upload their COVID-19 PCR NEGATIVE result and pay for a second PCR test to be done upon arrival in Nigeria. Ensure that the name registered on the NITP matches all travel documents. Present a hard copy of the negative COVID-19 test result, pre-boarding and at the point of entry in Nigeria. 3.Passengers must remain in self isolation for seven days on return to Nigeria, even if you test negative on entry. A repeat PCR test must be carried out on the 7th day after arrival, to ensure passengers have remained negative, given the risk of infection while traveling 4.For more information on international travel requirements, visit - https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/media/files/COVID19_Provisional_Quarantine_Protocol_for_Air_Travel_SA_Ako-CI_v.2_1.pdf SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 is spread primarily through respiratory droplets expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The risk of spread is higher in enclosed spaces, especially when ventilation is poor, and where there is poor adherence to the public health measures mandated. Common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, tiredness, sudden loss of taste or smell, diarrhoea, aches and pains. If you experience any of these symptoms, please avoid contact with others immediately. Call your state hotline (www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng) or visit a sample collection centre close to you. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control continues to work with the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to control the spread of COVID-19 and combatting the spread of the virus will only work with support and engagement from communities and institutions, while protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. We urge all Nigerians to take individual and collective responsibility to protect each other and our country. We are all this together.

Currently, over 64,000 cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in Nigeria, with over 50,000,000 confirmed globally. One of our NCDC’s key responsibilities as Nigeria’s National Public Health Institute is to provide Nigerians with timely and accurate information to reduce their risk of infection. This has been done through a website dedicated to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as an ongoing communications campaign with the theme #TakeResponsibility. These have formed the cornerstone of public health messaging on the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Our communications approach has leveraged social media, mainstream media and all other avenues to encourage Nigerians to take responsibility for protecting themselves and loved ones and preventing the spread of COVID-19. This new COVID-19 chat bot will serve as an additional medium to access validated, vetted and accurate information about COVID-19 and government’s efforts to control the pandemic. According to the Director General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, “At NCDC, we always leverage opportunities to use technological solutions to enhance the delivery of our mandate. Technology has been critical for strengthening our public health response to COVID-19. This interactive chatbot is a welcome initiative that will be integrated into existing technology deployed for communication at the NCDC. We are grateful to UNICEF and partners for supporting our efforts to provide Nigerians with prompt and reliable information on the COVID-19 pandemic.” Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Nigeria Representative also noted “COVID-19 is not to be taken lightly and needs to be discussed factually and accurately. We need to guard against misinformation to help save lives. The new chatbot is a useful tool that provides vetted and accurate information and response to the coronavirus pandemic.” UReport is an innovative mobile social monitoring platform for community participation to address issues that matter to young people. It is designed to give young people a chance to voice their opinions on issues in their communities, encourage citizen-led development and create a positive change. The chat bot can be accessed for free across all networks via SMS by sending the word “coronavirus” to the shortcode 24453. Also, Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp users can send the word “Coronavirus” to +2349087401607 as well as via the UReport platform on Facebook via @ureportnigeria respectively.

This is following reports of a sudden spike in cases and deaths in some communities in both states. On the 2nd and 3rd of November 2020, NCDC was notified by the State Ministries of Health of Delta and Enugu States respectively, of cases presenting with symptoms indicative of a viral haemorrhagic fever. Most cases presented with fever, headache, fatigue, jaundice vomiting (with or without blood) among others. As at the 6th of November 2020, three samples from Delta and one sample from Enugu tested positive for yellow fever at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Laboratory and NCDC’s National Reference Laboratory, Gaduwa. More samples are being tested from both states to confirm the causative organism of this outbreak. The State Epidemiology Teams are leading the response with support from NCDC, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). An incident management system has been activated by NCDC to coordinate response activities and Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have been deployed to both states. The NCDC and State RRTs are carrying out active case search, risk communications and community engagement as well as ensuring prompt management of cases. Our sister agency, NPHCDA is working with the affected states to plan for a vaccination campaign. Yellow fever is a vaccine-preventable disease, and a single shot provides immunity for a lifetime. Symptoms of the disease include yellowness of the eyes, sudden fever, headache and body pain. The yellow fever vaccine is available for free in primary health care centres in Nigeria as part of the national childhood routine immunisation schedule. The yellow fever virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises the public to take the following precautionary measures to reduce the risk of yellow fever infection: •Keep your environment clean and free of stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. •Use insecticide treated mosquito nets and install screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquito bites. •Avoid self-medication; visit a health facility immediately if you feel ill and have symptoms such as fever. •Healthcare workers are reminded to maintain a high index of suspicion for yellow fever amid the COVID-19 pandemic. •Please ensure your child is vaccinated against yellow fever as part of the national childhood routine immunisation schedule. If you are unsure of your immunisation status, please visit a health facility to receive a yellow fever vaccine. Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (arbovirus) which continues to cause severe morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. Following the strengthening of surveillance systems in Nigeria, a case of yellow fever was on the 12th of September 2017, 21 years after the last confirmed case. Since then, we have continued to confirm cases and clusters in Nigeria, while NPHCDA continues to deliver proactive and reactive vaccination campaigns in response. Nigeria is implementing WHO’s “EYE – Strategy”, to eliminate yellow-fever epidemics. The NCDC will continue working with the affected states, other government agencies and our partners to reduce the risk of spread of the disease and ensure cases are well-managed to reduce the number of deaths.

Self-medication is a common practice where patients often get antimicrobials without prescription and through unregulated supply chains. This results in the exposure of pathogens to antimicrobials that do not work sufficiently, thus increasing the chances of acquiring resistance and all its consequences. The emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms has led to increased mortality and economic burden. The Federal Government of Nigeria is contributing to the global response to the AMR threat, including the establishment of a committee that will work together to advocate for the responsible use of antimicrobials. To confront this threat, on the 26th of November 2016, the Honourable Minister for Health approved the establishment of Nigeria’s National AMR Coordinating Body at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Following this, a National AMR Technical Working Group (NAMR-TWG) was created in 2017, comprising One Health stakeholders i.e. human health, animal health, food animal production and environment sectors, pooled from Ministries, Departments, Agencies, development partners, private sector and civil society organizations. Since then, the NAMR-TWG have conducted an analysis of the AMR situation in Nigeria and developed a National Action Plan for AMR containment in the country. As part of Nigeria’s commitment to control AMR, 21 laboratories across the human, animal and environment sectors have been enrolled into the National AMR surveillance system, coordinated by NCDC. Of the 21 laboratories, three human health laboratories submit routine reports on six priority bacterial pathogens to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS). The GLASS is an initiative developed to support the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. In addition, NCDC has been training healthcare workers on infection prevention and control programmes in hospitals. Nigeria is a recipient of the UK Government Fleming Fund and receives support from the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization and other partners to strengthen ongoing efforts to strengthen surveillance for AMR in the human, animal and environment health sectors. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control convened the inaugural meeting of the National Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Coordination Committee on the 28th of September 2020. This Committee has been established to review the National Action Plan for AMR developed in 2017 and provide strategic guidance on implementing prioritised activities. The committee includes representatives from Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Environment, Health and Representatives from the development partners in the tripartite sectors (FAO, WHO, OIE and Fleming Fund). This group will work to ensure that Nigeria has a functional system to combat AMR, which includes surveillance capacity for resistance tracking and antimicrobial use, prevention of AMR in health care facilities, food production and the community. The group will work with relevant stakeholders to ensure the appropriate use of antimicrobials and sustain a multisectoral One-Health collaboration to take decisive and comprehensive action to limit AMR emergence.

This project was born out of the need for a treatment centre for serious infectious diseases in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) following the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak. As Nigeria’s Public Health Institute, NCDC has the mandate to lead the preparedness, detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies. This involves supporting states and building their capacity to respond to outbreaks. With directives from the Honourable Minister of Health, NCDC conducted a joint onsite assessment with relevant stakeholders in the FCT and it was agreed that UATH, Gwagwalada was strategically placed and suitable for the treatment centre. In addition to managing viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Lassa fever, this new, fully equipped 40-bed Infectious Disease Care Centre is designated for the management of cases of other infectious diseases including COVID-19 in the FCT. The treatment centre is also has a molecular laboratory for the prompt diagnosis of diseases. This project forms part of ongoing efforts by the Federal Ministry of Health and the NCDC to enhance capacity to manage cases of infectious diseases across the country towards strengthening health security. As of the 24th of September 2020, a total of 5,615 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in the FCT with a cumulative of 57,849 confirmed cases reported from all states in the country. At the official handover ceremony in Abuja, Professor Bisala Ekele, the Chief Medical Director of UATH reaffirmed the commitment of the hospital management to ensuring optimal utilisation of the treatment centre for the management of infectious diseases in the FCT including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The NCDC has supported the FCT Administration to mitigate the impact of the pandemic through training of health care workers on infection prevention and control (IPC), provision of medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), deployment of rapid response teams etc. NCDC has deployed and maintained a team of epidemiologists supporting the FCT Health Authorities in response to the pandemic. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the Director General of the NCDC, in his remarks reinforced the need for multi-sectoral collaboration and the need to build our health system in peace times to protect the health of Nigerians. “We have seen from the COVID-19 pandemic that big outbreaks can happen anytime, therefore, we must continue to invest in building a strong healthcare system even in the absence of a pandemic. NCDC remains committed to supporting all states and the FCT to build their capacity to prepare for and respond to infectious disease outbreaks in Nigeria”. Handing over the newly built treatment centre to UATH, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, the Honourable Minister of Health, commended the efforts of the NCDC and the management of UATH and further reiterated the federal government’s commitment to health security in Nigeria.

On the 10th of January 2021, Nigeria reached the “100,000 cases milestone”, with 100,087 confirmed cases and 1,358 deaths. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is issuing this public health advisory to alert the public that the non-adherence to public health and social measures is exacerbating the public health response efforts to limit the continued spread of COVID-19. The average number of daily confirmed cases recorded in the first week of January 2021, was higher than the cumulative cases recorded the last week of December 2020. Following the festive season, and in view of the increase in the number of confirmed cases in Nigeria, the NCDC and partners, with leadership from the Federal Ministry of Health and Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 is putting in place measures to strengthen the public health response to the pandemic. While the public may be tired of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact, the virus is taking advantage of the fatigue and complacency, instead gaining momentum and taking advantage of lapses in the adherence to the public health measures. To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, the public is reminded to wear a face mask properly, wash hands with soap and water, and physically distance from others. This is not the time to let down our guard. The virus that causes COVID-19 never went away and is still very much with us, as evidenced by the rising cases in Nigeria and globally. COVID-19 can affect all age groups with severe outcomes in the elderly (50 years and above), and in persons with co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer etc. Recently there has been increased infection among the younger age groups, therefore, NCDC urges all persons to take responsibility and adhere to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (regular hand washing, maintaining physical distance and proper use of face mask). As Nigeria’s public health institute, NCDC continues to work with other agencies under the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Health, in leading the public health response to the outbreak. In addition, the agency continues to play a key role in the multi-sectoral response, within the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF-COVID-19), established by President Muhammadu Buhari. Given the sustained increase in cases, NCDC continues to sustain the public health response by; Working closely with state governments, providing support through the deployment of Rapid Response Teams, provision of laboratory and medical supplies as well as other response activities. We urge state governments to take greater ownership of their response, maintaining their COVID-19 surveillance structures, laboratory diagnosis and testing. Unless states actively test, they will not know their disease burden, putting local communities at greater risk of adverse outcomes, if the virus is not detected and impacts vulnerable populations. NCDC has significantly scaled-up the national testing capacity by expanding the number of laboratories for COVID-19 testing across states. Testing remains one of the best tools we have in our fight against COVID-19, as it enables prompt clinical management and helps in preventing further transmission. The cumulative number of samples tested in the country has increased significantly, and some states have sustained their higher levels of testing. Although the country has yet to meet its total testing capacity, this remains a major priority for the response. Sample collection sites have also been established in many LGAs, making public health testing more easily accessible. Testing in public laboratories remains free of charge (unless for travel purposes in private laboratories, where pricing structures vary). Re-iterating to healthcare professionals that they must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially when treating patients with breathing difficulties and also present with symptoms common to COVID-19. The NCDC and partners have sustained the ongoing communications campaign, with the theme #TakeResponsibility. The aim is to encourage Nigerians to take individual and collective responsibility for their actions, taking the necessary precautions to protect themselves, their loved ones and all those they come in contact with. Nigerians are therefore urged to adhere to the recommended public health and social measures advised by public health authorities. Avoid all non-essential travel within and outside Nigeria to reduce the risk of transmission. The virus that causes COVID-19 is more likely to spread in mass gatherings, especially in confined spaces with poor ventilation. It is advised that people avoid mass gatherings during this time, and if necessary meet outdoors and adhere to physical distancing and other public health measures. All these measures are critical in order to sustain the gains made since the onset of the pandemic. We also strongly advise business owners, employees and religious leaders to institute the strict enforcement and adherence to public measures, which include the wearing of face masks, ensuring the availability of handwashing facilities or providing hand sanitizers. The NCDC remains grateful to all frontline health workers, state public health teams, stakeholders, and partners who have continued to work extremely hard since the beginning of the pandemic supporting the response efforts. We are all eager to get back to the normalcy in our lives, so the continued response and end to the outbreak starts and ends with all of us. We remain committed to protecting the health of all Nigerians.

This number has been introduced as a means for the public to contact NCDC’s Connect Centre and access verified information on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The short code is a toll free and easy-to-remember number, which means that all calls to NCDC through “6232” are free of charge. This is to ensure all Nigerians have access to verified information on infectious diseases. In 2016, NCDC established its Connect Centre as a critical aspect of its event-based surveillance and risk communications strategy. Over the years, this has been used for the response to infectious disease outbreaks such as Lassa fever, monkeypox, yellow fever, cerebrospinal meningitis etc. Following the confirmation of Nigeria’s first COVID-19 case, NCDC immediately expanded its Connect Centre capacity to meet the increasing need for information by Nigerians. This was done in close collaboration with relevant government institutions and with support from our partners. The call lines were expanded to receive multiple calls simultaneously, automated chatbots were activated to disseminate information in real-time, additional human resource and volunteers were engaged, and a new quality assurance system was introduced. Between March and December 2020, the NCDC Connect Centre received over 580,000 COVID-19 related phone calls. The short code number ‘6232’ will be used alongside the existing toll free number – ‘0800 9700 0010’, with a gradual phase-out of the existing toll free number. We thank the NCC and our partners at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, GAVI, UNICEF, University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), Georgetown University, Resolve to Save Lives and Interra Networks for their support. Additionally, we recognise and thank mobile network providers in Nigeria - Globacom, MTN, Airtel, 9mobile – who have continued to support our efforts in communicating with Nigerians. The NCDC remains strongly committed to work with relevant government institutions and partners to protect the health of Nigerians. We urge the public to use the short code responsibly, in accessing verified information on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

The Vice President was received at the apex laboratory by the Honourable Minister of Health, Honourable Minister of State for Health, and the Director General of NCDC. Directors as well as other members of NCDC staff and partners were also present at the visit. The visit of the Vice President was an opportunity for him to appreciate the efforts of NCDC staff, State Public Health Teams and other public health workers who have been working tirelessly in response to the pandemic for about a year. During his visit, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo recognised and praised the efforts of NCDC staff and other public health workers, which he described as “heroic”. The Vice President interacted with the laboratory staff while on tour of the facility and observed operations at the molecular laboratory, the HIV mega-laboratory, its biorepository for the storage of samples and other areas of the facility. He reiterated the commitment of the President Muhammed Buhari administration to prioritise and strengthen health security. The Honourable Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, while welcoming the Vice President, also commended NCDC’s critical role in the prevention, detection and response to disease outbreaks. “We are very proud of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, which is our youngest agency at the Federal Ministry of Health. In the last four years, the agency has grown significantly in its mandate and delivery. The achievements of NCDC in Nigeria’s public health response have been as a result of the resilience, dedication and commitment of its leadership and staff. Thank you, Your Excellency, for honouring their hardwork with your visit today.” The Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu expressed his gratitude to the Vice President for his visit. He shared the agency’s journey with establishing the NRL, including the COVID-19 response and challenges. “We remain grateful to the Executive arm of the Government for the strong political commitment to strengthen health security in the country. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for stable, substantial and sustainable funding for health security. We were able to activate the NRL and three other laboratories for COVID-19 diagnosis in January 2020, because we had been preparing for the next pandemic for four years. Nigeria must invest in health security for us to be better prepared for the next pandemic.” Since the confirmation of Nigeria’s first COVID-19 case in February 2020, NCDC, supported by its partners, has been leading Nigeria’s committed public health response to the pandemic. This includes establishing and scaling up capacity for COVID-19 testing, surveillance activities, risk communications, as well as providing technical support to states and several other activities. The NCDC National Reference Laboratory (NRL) was initially operationalised in May 2017. Prior to this, Nigeria did not have a Public Health Laboratory for epidemic-prone diseases. Since its establishment, the NRL has developed molecular capacity for the diagnosis of many epidemic prone diseases such as yellow fever, Lassa fever, monkeypox, cholera as well as highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola virus. In response to the emergence f SARS CoV2 the virus that causes COVID 19, NCDC rapidly developed its capacity to make the diagnosis and has also led on the activation of 112 public and private laboratories across Nigeria. Through these efforts, every state in Nigeria now has at least one molecular laboratory with the capacity to test for COVID-19. The pandemic has created an opportunity to establish molecular laboratories and testing capacity that can be used for other epidemic-prone diseases. Till date, Nigeria has conducted over one million COVID-19 tests with over 70% of these carried out in public health laboratories. A large proportion of these tests have been conducted at the NRL, where NCDC staff have maintained a 24/7 shift since the beginning of the pandemic. The NRL was selected by WHO and Africa CDC in 2020, as one of eight sequencing laboratories in the African region. In this position, the laboratory serves as a regional reference sequencing laboratory for COVID-19 and other emerging pathogens.

The natural reservoir for the virus is the Mastomys natalensis rodent (commonly known as the multimammate rat). Other rodents have also been identified as carriers of the virus. Lassa fever remains a major public health challenge in West Africa with Nigeria bearing the highest burden. Lassa fever occurs throughout the year but more cases are recorded during the dry season i.e. November through May. Lassa fever is spread through: 1.Direct contact with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 2.Contact with objects, household items and surfaces or eating food, contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 3.Person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever can also occur through contact with blood, urine, faeces, vomitus and other body fluids of an infected person, particularly within a hospital environment where there is poor infection prevention and control measures. Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever: Lassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria. Its symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, general body weakness, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, chest pain, and in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nose, mouth and other body openings. The time between an infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease is 3 to 21 days. Early diagnosis and treatment increases the chances of survival. Healthcare workers are most at risk of person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever especially: Doctors, nurses and other health workers providing direct patient care in the absence of standard precautions. Hospital staff who clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies without adequate protective gear Laboratory staff who handle blood samples of suspected Lassa fever patients without appropriate precautions Medical or support staff who prepare and or handle dead bodies of Lassa fever patients without appropriate precautions To reduce the risk of Lassa fever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) offers the following advice to all healthcare workers: Practice standard precautions at all times while handling patients and body fluids i.e. always wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) irrespective of patient’s provisional diagnosis Maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever i.e. be vigilant and lookout for Lassa fever, not all fevers are malaria. Lassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria Test all suspected cases of malaria using Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). When the RDT is negative, other causes of febrile illness including Lassa fever should be considered Any febrile illness that has not responded to use of anti-malaria or antibiotics after 48 hours should raise an index of suspicion for Lassa fever! The national guidelines for Lassa fever case management and Infection prevention and control are available on the NCDC website for download (http://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines) Please report all suspected cases of Lassa fever to your Local Government Area disease surveillance and notification officer who are the initial linkage to response and care for Lassa fever cases in Nigeria.

The natural reservoir for the virus is the Mastomys natalensis rodent (commonly known as the multimammate rat). Other rodents have also been identified who carry the virus. Lassa fever remains a major public health challenge in West Africa with Nigeria bearing the highest burden. Lassa fever occurs throughout the year but more cases are recorded during the dry season i.e. November through May. Lassa fever is spread through: 1.Direct contact with urine, faces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 2.Contact with objects, household items and surfaces or eating food, contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 3.Person to person transmission by contact with blood, urine, faeces, vomitus, and other body fluids of an infected person. Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever: Lassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria. Its symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, general body weakness, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, chest pain, and in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nose, mouth and other body openings. The time between an infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease is 3 to 21 days. Early treatment and diagnosis increases the chances of survival. People most at risk are: •People of all age groups who come in contact with the urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats •People living in rat infested environments which increases their chances of coming in contact with rats •People who consume potentially contaminated food stuff especially those left open over-night or dried outside in the open •People who handle or process rodents for consumption •People who do not perform hand hygiene when appropriate •Relatives who care for sick person with unexplained illnesses at home •Health care workers including: oDoctors, nurses and other health workers providing direct patient care in the absence of standard precautions. oHospital staff who clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies without adequate protective gear oLaboratory staff who handle blood samples of suspected Lassa fever patients without appropriate precautions oMedical or support staff who prepare and or handle dead bodies without appropriate precautions To reduce the risk of Lassa fever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) offers the following advice: •Ensure proper environmental sanitation – i.e. keep your environment clean at all times, block all holes in your house to prevent rats from entry. •Cover your dustbins and dispose refuse properly. Communities should setup dump sites very far from their homes to reduce the chances of having rodents within homes •Store foodstuff like rice, garri, beans, corn/maize etc. containers which are well covered with tight fitting lids •Avoid drying food stuff outside on the floor, roadside where it will be exposed to contamination •Avoid bush burning which can lead to displacement of rats from bushes to human dwellings •Eliminate rats in homes and communities by setting rat traps and other means •Practice good personal hygiene by frequent washing hands with soap under running water /or use of hand sanitizers when appropriate •Visit the nearest health facility if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever as mentioned earlier, avoid self-medication •Healthcare workers are advised to practice standard precautions at all times: i.e. wearing gloves while handling patients or providing care to an ill patient/relative. •Healthcare workers should maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever i.e. be vigilant and lookout for signs and symptoms of Lassa fever Any febrile illness that has not responded to 48 hours use of anti-malaria or antibiotics should raise an index of suspicion for Lassa fever! Please if your healthcare worker suspects Lassa fever, advise him or her to contact your local government disease surveillance and notification officer to access care in Nigeria.

In September 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) of two Ag RDTs, manufactured by SD Biosensor and Abbott for COVID-19 testing. Following this, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control in collaboration with other stakeholders carried out a national validation of these RDTs. The validation which was carried out during the screening held at National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camps, showed that the RDTs meet the minimal standards for sensitivity and specificity of COVID 19 diagnostic tests. As more Ag RDTs gain EUA from WHO, we will consider their use in Nigeria. This new guidance published by NCDC, is to guide the use of RDTs in Nigeria. We are recommending its use, primarily in congregate settings. These include settings such as schools, hospitals for the testing of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 presenting in hospital triage areas and periodic testing of health care workers, in prisons etc. While RDTs provide a faster turnaround time compared to the molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, there are limitations with this test. For example, the currently available Ag-RDTs have a lower sensitivity compared to PCR tests. The test can therefore present false negative results in people who have been infected with the virus. This is why the molecular PCR method remains the gold standard for testing. An algorithm has been included in the guidance to ensure that cases such as this are not missed. The NCDC is introducing the use of these rapid antigen tests, to contribute to Nigeria’s overall COVID-19 testing capacity. The Ag-RDTs provide significant advantages over other available testing methods, especially in terms of shorter turnaround times and reduced costs. The correct use of Ag-RDTs will also enable the Government of Nigeria to increase the pace of testing, tracing and providing care for people with COVID-19. The Ag-RDTs developed by Abbott and SD Biosensor are highly portable and easy to administer. However, infection prevention and control measures must be adhered to by trained health workers administering the test. Further information on this is contained in the guidance published by NCDC. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, NCDC has continued to lead Nigeria’s public health response activities. As part of this, the agency has been leading the expansion of testing capacity across the country. Till date, 112 public and private testing laboratories have been activated across all states and the Federal Capital Territory. Of the 112 laboratories, 74 of these are public health laboratories and provide testing free of charge to the general public. It is important that Nigerians are aware of the increasing risk of spread of COVID-19. As of the 17th of January 2021, over 100,000 people have been infected with more than 1,400 deaths from COVID-19 in Nigeria. We urge all Nigerians to take responsibility to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. Please practice regular handwashing, avoid mass gatherings, wear a face mask properly and ensure physical distancing at all times. The NCDC remains committed to working with State Governments, other institutions through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and partners to strengthen Nigeria’s COVID-19 prevention and response activities.

He was referred from a private hospital in Asaba, Delta State, where he was receiving treatment until his condition deteriorated. On presentation at the Accident and Emergency of NAUTH, Lassa fever was suspected, blood samples collected and sent to the reference laboratory at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo State, where the diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed. He died within an hour of admission. The State Public Health authorities in Anambra and Delta States have commenced a public health response including epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and the prepositioning of drugs and supplies. As at 22 August 2016, 40 contacts have been identified in Delta State and 19 in Anambra State. All contacts are currently being monitored for symptoms of Lassa fever. The Delta and Anambra States Ministries of Health are coordinating the responses in their respective states, while the NCDC provides support and guidance to limit further spread. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in some states in Nigeria and thus its sporadic occurrence is not unexpected. It is in this light that Nigerians are advised to remain calm and supportive of public health authoorities. According to the National Coordinator and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu; “This case again illustrates the importance of following clinical protocols to confirm the cause of febrile illnesses, especially malaria, before treatment. Regarding the confirmed case of Lassa fever, we are working closely with the relevant State Government teams to limit further spread. We encourage health workers and health facilities across the country to maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever and indeed other viral hemorrhagic fevers. We also encourage State governments and their Ministries of Health to sustain adequate detection and response capacity.” The report in certain media outlets of three cases of Lassa fever in Anambra is false. The Nigeria Center for Disease Control will continue to keep all our channels of communication open for information, verification and reporting on Lassa fever and other disease emergencies. The Centre’s 24/7 toll-free line can be reached via 0800-970000-10; and the twitter account handle @NCDCgov, and Facebook page @nigeriacdc are always available for inquiry and updates.

The African Union is considering Nigeria as one of the host countries of the continental center for disease control. This means if selected, the Center for Disease Control of Nigeria will co-serve as a coordinating institution as a regional and continental center. As Nigeria prepares to welcome delegates of experts from across the continent, representatives of the World Health Organisation, United States Center for Disease Control, China Center for Disease Control and the West Africa Health Organisation, we proudly showcase our readiness as a hub of human capital with broad experience in local and regional response to disease prevention and control. Since 2014 when the current leadership of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control commenced operations, the country has embarked upon audacious interventions around infrastructure development, capacity building, global partnership and research. These efforts came timely during the Ebola outbreak during which Nigeria developed methods that helped in containing her local outbreak and was also able to support neighbouring countries with major outbreaks. Indeed the intervention of Nigeria was key to the West African containment of the outbreak. This response yielded further global leadership for Nigeria as Nigerian experts now serve on global committees and have been decorated in different parts of the world for their outstanding efforts. The formation of the Nigeria CDC through networks of research centers, laboratories and collaborating academic centers across the country creates a national web which allows for rapid response. These assets which had been on ground before the formation of the NCDC were consolidated into an institution which now coordinates central and remote operational sites. As the most populous country in Africa with diverse socio-economic factors, the country found a rigorous learning ground for management of multifaceted array of events with serious public health implications. From the military to private sector institutions and other government institutions, which continue to work within the network of institutions of the NCDC, Nigeria has grown preparedness and capacities for global health security concerns and continues to respond successfully to these conditions from time to time. The infrastructure and talent pool of experts has equally created a technology backbone which can sustain data exchange processes of varying scales. This has helped in the development of local tools of global excellence which have helped in response to disease outbreaks in Nigeria and beyond. Finally, the political commitment of Nigeria to disease control is clear. President Muhammad Buhari clearly stated in his inaugural speech, in May 2015, that his government will work with global partners in effort to tackle global diseases threats. This position is expected to reflect in rapid development of the NCDC through infrastructural upgrade, capacity building and financing. Nigeria as the entertainment hub of Africa will make a great destination for scientists from around the world. Our weather, culture and food coupled with our dance, music and Nollywood makes it the place to position the Africa Center for Disease Control. Nigeria proudly expresses interest in hosting Africa year round. We have hosted our brothers from across the continent, over and over again. We want to become one of the African homes to disease control and prevention experts from around the world. We invite all Nigerians to join us in the campaign; it is good for us today, it is good for our children tomorrow.

In May 2015, the Highest Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government approved this recommendation and a Regional Center for Disease Surveillance and Control (ECOWAS/RCDC). In December 2015, two community regulations regarding the setting up and operation of the Regional Center for Disease Surveillance and Control and the establishment of a network for the surveillance of epidemics and infectious diseases in West Africa were adopted by the ECOWAS Council of Ministers in Abuja. This sets into motion the formation of board of directors which comprises among others of six members representing the National Coordinating Institutions of Members states. The Inaugural board meeting held in Abuja, Nigeria between 27th and 28th June 2016. This regional coordination center was set-up as a post-Ebola initiative to help the sub-region, under the leadership of West Africa Health Organization (WAHO), strengthen preparedness and response against future public health emergencies. It is believed it is with platforms of this nature that such outbreaks as Ebola and the other major health emergencies can be properly prevented and controlled across borders. As part of the milestone of the establishment of the center, a board was set-up to lead the formulation of policies which will help drive ministries of health of member states as they play their roles as part of the collective efforts in the West African sub region. Therefore the board meeting will have representatives of all ministries of health of 6 West African states representing the ECOWAS 15-member states. In addition, Nigeria was selected to host and establish the RCSDC using the country’s center for disease control, i.e. Nigeria Center for Disease Control, as a platform for immediate take-off of the Regional center. This means the RCSDC will be operating from within the Headquarters of the Nigerian Center for Disease Control in Abuja, Nigeria. The choice of Nigeria was based on the country’s successful Ebola response which evidently informed other West African states’ strategies towards the ultimate containment of the outbreak, the human capital base and most importantly leadership commitment. The president of Nigeria, President Muhammad Buhari, is personally committed to this regional framework and efforts towards mitigating and responding to disease emergencies. The Nigerian minister of health, Professor Isaac Adewole, is equally committed towards ensuring the Nigerian platform helps achieve successful establishment of the RCSDC. The acting Executive Director of the RCSDC, Dr. Abdusalami Nasidi, who is also the National Coordinator and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Center for Disease Control, was selected for his role in leading his agency to driving the successful national response back in 2014. The opening ceremony of the meeting was attended by dignitaries from the Nigerian Senate, National Assembly, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (NFELTP), US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), European Union Commission (EU), Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Red Cross. At the event the honourable Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, shared the dedicated of Nigeria towards the success of the ECOWAS-RCSDC. He declared the meeting open on Monday 27th June, 2016. The Director General of West Africa Health Organization, Dr. Xavier Crespin, chaired the two-day meeting whose deliberation and outcomes will be published widely for stakeholders’ alignment. Key activities at the meeting were: Exchange of Memorandum of Understanding between Nigeria and West Africa Health Organisation, Official announcement of Dr. Abdusalami Nasidi as the Executive Director of ECOWAS-RCSDC, Development of the 2016 – 2017 work plan of the ECOWAS-RCSDC, An exchange session between the board and young public health professionals, and A dinner The Participants at the Inaugural Board Meeting of ECOWAS-RCSDC were: Dr Xavier CRESPIN, OOAS/WAHO Dr Carlos Pedro Faria de Brito, OOAS/WAHO Dr Abdusalami Nasidi, Nigeria Dr. Samba Ceesay, The Gambia Dr. Badu Sarkodie, Ghana Dr Placido Monteiro Cardoso, Guinee Bissau Dr Lamine KOIVOGUI, Guinee Dr Abdoulaye Bousso, Senegal Dr Daniel EKLU, CEDEAO Mr. Richard Awunyo, OOAS/WAHO Mme Savage Ami Ibrahim, OOAS/WAHO Maître Ely Diallo, OOAS/WAHO Dr. Bakary Sylla, CORDS HQ Prof. Nigel Lightfoot, CORDS HQ Dr Karim Tounkara, OIE Dr Henri Kaboré, CRSA", "date_published": "Wednesday, September 28, 2016", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:50"}

This meeting brought together local parties involved in the implementation of the legal regulations. The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 are legally binding regulations (forming international law) that aim to a) assist countries to work together to save lives and livelihoods endangered by the spread of diseases and other health risks by implementing commensurate measures , while b) avoiding unnecessary interference with international trade and travel. In this light all local government agencies working directly or indirectly on these two key functions have a role to play in the implementation of the regulation. The meeting was chaired by the National Focal Point Responsible Person for IHR and the Director of Surveillance at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Mrs. Olubunmi Ojo; with the National Coordinator and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre in attendance. There were also other participants from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Nigerian Immigration Service, Nigeria Civil Aviation Agency, The National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency, Participants, at the four hours long meeting, deliberated on the current national workplan for the implementation of the IHR and the roles and responsibilities of sectors involved in its implementation and coordination. An update on designation of Nigeria’s Point of Entry was shared as one of the key immediate goals of the country in the implementation of the IHR. This stakeholders meeting is the first after the resumption of office by the CEO of the NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu. According to Dr. Chikwe, “we are aware Nigeria has not been as proactive as it should be in taking ownership of the implementation of IHR. but with the commitment we are bringing into this process we look forward to exciting moments that will bring coordination and confidence into the process towards protecting the lives of Nigerians.” Dr. Mary Stephen of the World Health Organisation also commended the NCDC for bringing together the meeting, she added that “this is a good way forward, Nigeria needs to build on the momentum gathered here today to help achieve desired level of preparedness and disease detection amongst other key outcomes of the IHR” The Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and management of public health events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA) was also represented at the meeting by Dr. Wilfred Haggai, the Team Leader of ICAO CAPSCA Africa Project, who also represented the NCAA. Dr. Haggai commented that, “The leadership and coordination experienced here today gives me the confidence that we will galvanize relevant stakeholder with our port health service to ensure our ports of entry get designated as soon as possible, at least one in the short term.”", "date_published": "Monday, October 10, 2016", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:50"}

The first set of responders are currently on the ground in Borno and have commenced a rapid assessment of the situation which will guide immediate response. On Friday 22nd July, 2016, the first joint press briefing was held in Maiduguri, Borno State, where the National Coordinator/CEO of the NCDC and the Commissioner of Health of Borno shared some of the provisional findings and plans of the response. The full text of the press briefing can be found below: Ladies and Gentlemen of the press. You will all recall that a High Level Emergency Round-Table meeting on Malnutrition Crisis in Borno was held at the end of June, 2016, in Abuja. This meeting had the Executive Governor of Borno, H.E. Alhaji Hon. Kashim Shetima, the Hon. Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Folorunsho Adewole, Heads of all major partners and some NGOs, including the Head UN Humanitarian Coordination in attendance. The meeting recognized the Health and Humanitarian crisis in Borno and recommended, among others the immediate need to reach 750,000 persons affected (children and adults, including pregnant women) within the next three months with food/nutrition and Health interventions, because of the high prevalence of severe acute malnutrition recorded in Borno. The meeting recognized that except this done urgently, at least 5 children will die every hour and the impact on the health status of the population will be high. It was agreed that the figure currently being released by the emergency teams on ground could be representing just a tip of the iceberg and thus to prevent disaster and mitigate the impact of this dire situation a long term multi-sectoral collaboration, integrated approach and coordinated response is required. The findings from the affected areas have confirmed that about 2.4 million IDPs are currently in the North-east and about 2 million (83%) of this are in Borno and only 9% of this are in IDP camps and 90% in host communities. Nearly half of the Health facilities are either destroyed or looted. A Technical Working Group formed by the meeting drew up a response plan which cost about $390 million to address the crisis and mitigate its impact. The Technical Group also identified areas of immediate intervention and recommended immediate deployment of the response teams in the following areas: food and nutrition, immunization, out-patient care, in-patient care, reproductive health care, psycho-social and mental health care, potable waste supply and sanitation. The Honorable Minister of Health established a Rapid Response Team headed by Dr. Joshua Obasanya and deployed the team to Borno to kick start the emergency response activities in collaboration with the Borno State Ministry of Health. Additionally, the recent upsurge in military operations had made it possible for a large number of previously trapped populations to be rescued and brought to safe places in IDP camps and host communities. These persons with a wide variety of problems, including health challenges, such as malnutrition, diarrheal diseases, measles, chronic diseases, trauma and psycho-social conditions. There were persons who were out of reach to any service in the past, including health and other basic human needs for up to 5 years in some cases and are now contributing to the number of those in need of the emergency services. There are 2 satellite camps spread all over 8 LGAs that include Bama,Dikwa, Monguno, Kukawa, Gwoza, Damboa, Mafa, Ngala and even a spillover into Niger Republic. In light of the above, the Federal Government in stepping-in to support the on-going efforts of Borno state and partner agencies to effectively and efficiently address this response through enhanced and effective coordination, collaboration and resource mobilization. The approach to this response shall; henceforth be based on a One-Emergency, One-Plan, One-Response to which all partners will to buy-in in order to better address the situation effectively. To this end a Health sector Response Group have been formed comprising the Federal, State and Health partners and Representatives of various NGOs. The group has moved into action and has developed a clearly defined command structure that has the Honorable Commissioner of Health and Head of the Federal RRT as co-Chairs. The group shall be reporting to the Chairman of the Central Coordinating Responses (the SSG) in the State and to the Minister of Health at the Federal Level. The Health sector team, partners and the FMOH have already started mobilizing resources to kick-start the operation and will continue doing this as the need arise. To make the response even more coordinated, it is important that henceforth information related to this response should emanate from the office of the Hon. Commissioner of Health Borno State who is working hand-in-hand with his counterpart in Ministry of Information who handles all information from the central coordination, headed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG). To conclude, may I, on behalf of H.E. the Executive Governor of Borno State and the Hon. Minister of Health call on All stakeholders in the Health Sector response to key-in into this new multi-sectoral coordinated approach for effective service delivery and contribute maximally towards attaining our set objectives. I have little or no doubt that this approach will enable us reach our targets within a reasonable period, as directed by our principals. Finally, may I invite various communities and the press to contribute in our efforts to mobilize the people, manpower and resources to overcome this challenge. Thank you for your attention.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/66/response-to-aids-cure-claim-by-nigerian-scientist", "title": "RESPONSE TO AIDS CURE CLAIM BY NIGERIAN SCIENTIST", "body": "Our attention has been drawn to a recent media statement by Maduike Ezeibe, a Professor of Veterinary Medicine and Clinical Virology at the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, claiming to have discovered a new drug for the cure of HIV/AIDS. An editorial in the newspaper “Leadership” (http://leadership.ng/opinions/569782/nigerian-scientist-conquers-hivaids), quoted the professor as saying that the drug, produced with “Aluminium Magnesium Silicate” was tested on ten persons living with HIV. The newspaper reported a clinical outcome of an ability to “reach all cells” and making HIV “a conquered organism”. The claim for an HIV/AIDS cure is not new. It is also not new to find a scientist using ambiguous scientific methods and practices to buttress this claim, and to find obscure journals increasingly prepared to publish these claims. To examine the facts, this study was published in two little known journals and involved less than ten patients. In the “clinical trial” as reported, there was no evidence of the use of controls, which is the basis of all efficacy trials. Without controls, you can neither have randomisation nor blinding, two other critical factors in studying the effects of new medicines. Critically the primary outcome measured in this study was based on plasma viral load levels that are known to fluctuate in patients, even in the absence of any intervention. It is also worth noting that virological suppression (viral load of less than 50 copies/ml) was not achieved in 6 of the patients. There appeared to be no medical doctor involved in the execution of this study and there was no evidence on where or how the patients were treated or monitored during this study, or their clinical and treatment status at the beginning, or at the end of it. It is important to note that the testing of new chemical compounds starts with drug design and then proceeds on to animal testing. If successful, clinical trials are conducted in a series of phases - each phase is designed to answer a separate research question. These include; Phase I: Researchers test a new drug to evaluate its safety. Phase II: The drug is given to a larger group of people to study its efficacy against an agreed outcome. Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, comparing it to commonly used treatments, and Phase IV: Studies are done to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. The authors of this study did not state what phase their study was in and the results of previous phases, if these were done. One critical issue is that there was no evidence from the publication that the authors obtained ethical clearance from an appropriate body in Nigeria to conduct this study, and only ambiguous evidence that informed consent was sought from the evidently vulnerable patients. As a result of the above issues with this process, there is really no basis for a claim to cure of AIDS in this study. We are concerned that the publicity given to these claims will stop patients with HIV from taking life-saving antiretrovirals and give them false hope of a cure. It will be a great disservice to this vulnerable group of patients for the media to disseminate these claims in the absence of sound scientific evidence. There are long established, tried and tested routes for the discovery, development and validation of modern medicines before they can be registered and used for treatment in humans. We call on all academics to follow legal and scientifically acceptable methods in conducting their research and to avoid making premature claims that are capable of derailing the huge progress made in the last two decades on the war against HIV/AIDS. Millions of lives have been saved as a result of modern antiretroviral treatment and people living with HIV can now look forward to a normal healthy future. We continue to support the hard and diligent work being done by scientists in our Universities and research institutions around the country. We are always ready to partner with our scientists on all aspects of HIV research provided this is in line with international best practice. We call on editors of media houses in Nigeria to seek comments from the leadership of the relevant government parastatals and professional bodies when it receives new research findings related to our areas of responsibility. Following the discrediting of the claims of Dr. Abalaka in the late nineties, we had hoped that the Nigerian press would thoroughly investigate these “AIDS cure” claims before going to press, given the huge impact that these claims could have on patients' lives. We assure you that we will respond rapidly and constructively to any queries. We also urge the editors of media houses in Nigeria to support their reporters to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in the clinical trial process. In the run up to deadlines, it is easy to fall into the trap of doing more harm than good, and the consequences of this can be deadly in the health sector. We will support the evolution of robust science journalism in Nigeria. We call on all patients living with HIV that are currently taking their medications to continue to do so and to see their doctors if they have any concern. The NACA helpline (6222) is available on working days from 8am-8pm for members of the public seeking more information on HIV disease.", "date_published": "Tuesday, February 07, 2017", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:51"}

He made this assertive conviction about the capability of the Federal government after his ministry issued public advisory warning to Nigerians after 328 deaths associated with Meningitis have been recorded since November 2016 when he spoke extensively on efforts employed and deployed so far to curtail the further spread of the epidemic. In his words, \"we have started working with all the affected states in specific areas of collaboration on massive awareness and sensitization, laboratory investigation and analysis, proper documentation and disease surveillance techniques through the National Centre for Disease Control and National Primary Health Care Development Authority (NPHCDA) who have been of tremendous support since the outbreak. We are in constant discussion with World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, E-health Africa and other international health agencies for supplies of vaccines and injections. Through our initiatives, we have secured 500,000 doses of the meningococcal vaccines from WHO which will be used in Zamfara and Katsina states while additional 800,000 units from the British government .By next Tuesday, there will be a meeting with the International Review Group of The World Health Organization (WHO) where request for additional vaccines shall be approved, as part of practical and medically certified efforts to stem this ugly incidence. Even with the tunnels of accomplishment made, we are not relenting on all the progress made, as we have been assured of millions of vaccine doses through other notable and international donor agencies. Unfortunately, Nigeria had always been bedevilled with the stereotype A in years past but this new strain of the bacterial disease, Meningitis Stereotype C which the vaccine is not commercially available in required quantities and can only be shipped to the country by WHO only if laboratory investigation confirms the existence of the strain type C. Our ongoing spirited effort is geared to upscale through nationwide immunisation campaign while navigating the menace using a combination vaccine by conducting active case finding, strengthening surveillance, case detection, verification and communication management, performing lumbar puncture of suspect cases in a well coordinated atmosphere under NCDC. Our partners are already re-training physicians on the effective collection of cerebrospinal fluid for diagnosis. We are equally advocating for prompt diagnosis and have issued directive to all Federal medical facilities and PHCs to treat all cases of meningitis free of charge. All Nigerians especially residents of Katsina, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto, Niger, Zamfara and Jigawa states are advised to seek early attention when discomforted with symptoms of Cerebro Spinal Meningitis (CSM) and avoid clogging together in unventilated and over-crowded rooms.

With the gradually improving security situation and increasing access to services, a health and humanitarian emergency has emerged. One of the more obvious consequences is the now well-publicized nutrition emergency. The Nigerian Government and its partners in the international community have mounted a vigorous response to this. When there is a nutritional emergency, very few people die from poor nutrition itself. One primary cause of death in these situations, is an increased vulnerability to communicable diseases. Given that many of the health workers in Borno have been affected themselves one way or the other, it is no surprise that the ability of Borno to detect, verify and respond to infectious diseases has severely diminished. When the insurgency started, a number of affected areas in Borno were inaccessible to disease surveillance officers and in some extreme cases, these officers were displaced too. This led to a vacuum of knowledge to what was going in those communities. As Nigeria commenced a concerted counter-insurgency operation in 2015, many communities have been freed and gradually support systems are increasingly able to access these places to provide humanitarian services in form of healthcare, nutrition, capacity building and jobs. This helped reveal the depth of suffering that was hidden for months. Two of the most apparent health consequences were striking malnutrition and the reemergence of polio in the region. In response to the malnutrition, the Honorable Minister of Health declared a nutritional emergency in the North East. This flagged an emergency response aimed at responding to the nutritional and other health related challenges identified in Borno. As part of the response, a team led by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) with support from its partners, was constituted to support Borno State in re-building its disease surveillance and response capabilities. This includes re-training on surveillance tools, supporting response activities and providing the State team with appropriate IT infrastructure for their activities. Over the past weeks, NCDC has been working closely with the Borno State Government to rebuild their surveillance and response capabilities. From helping regain confidence of the people, to capacity building for the Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers at the State and LG levels, to revamping the reporting system and support to laboratories towards laboratory networks for early diagnosis; the goal is to set up a reliable surveillance to assure the health security of the people of Borno. Reflecting on the security challenges of working in Borno, NCDC Team Lead, Dr. Oladejo John remarked after one of the recent explosions that went off hours after a meeting was completed, - “There are uncertainties around the job; but we must stay to support the people of Borno”. As the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control pushes further to collect, collate and analyse data that will guide definitive action in the region, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu asserts the purpose of NCDC’s commitment to the task. According to him, “This is the beginning of a long process. What happened with Polio is unfortunate. What we must do is to put in place systems to prevent recurrence in the future.”", "date_published": "Tuesday, December 06, 2016", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:51"}

The Nigeria Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) calls the attention of Nigerians to an increasing number of Lassa fever cases, and advices increased focus on prevention and preparedness. In the last quarter of 2016, the NCDC commenced the implementation of its Lassa Fever preparedness plan ahead of the current dry season to strengthen nationwide capacity to prevent, detect and respond to the anticipated Lassa fever cases. Since the beginning of this current dry season in December 2016, 7 states have reported at least one case of Lassa Fever. 19 confirmed cases and 6 deaths have been reported by these 7 states, as seen in the table below. OGUN Confirmed Cases: 2 Death: 2 TARABA Confirmed Cases: 6 Death: 1 NASARAWA Confirmed Cases: 2 Death: 0 EDO Confirmed Cases: 1 Death: 0  ONDO Confirmed Cases: 1 Death: 0 RIVERS Confirmed Cases: 1 Death: 0 PLATEAU Confirmed Cases: 6 Death: 3  TOTAL Confirmed Cases: 19 Death: 6 NCDC is working closely with affected states to ensure an appropriate response to these cases. Social mobilisation activities and sensitisation of health workers are being scaled up. The outbreak response commodities that were prepositioned in the states by NCDC are being used for the response. Epidemiological response activities such as contact listing and tracing are also going in the affected states. States that had previously identified and resourced isolation units as they were advised are much better prepared to deal with cases. It is encouraging to see that where patients present early and where healthcare workers have a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever, Lassa fever patients are walking out of the treatment centres in good health. When diagnosis and treatment is late, it reduces the likelihood of recovery. Lassa fever is curable when there is rapid laboratory testing to confirm the disease, leading to early commencement of treatment. To prevent Lassa fever in the community, Nigerians are advised to keep their food safe from rats and rat excreta. Critically, Lassa fever transmission in healthcare settings can be prevented by strict adherence to universal precautions. Doctors and nurses are advised to hold each other accountable to insist on these precautions. NCDC urges Nigerians to cooperate with their respective state governments in this response. Lassa is endemic in Nigeria, and molecular dating suggests that Lassa virus has been circulating in Nigeria for over a thousand years and in some other West African countries for hundreds of years. The NCDC will continue to support states across the country through this dry season. A Lassa Fever working group has been set-up at NCDC to ensure no state is left behind. Reports from states show prepositioned materials have been critical for states to respond immediately to cases.; Prevention of Lassa fever begins with a state of awareness. This disease is preventable and can be treated. Improving food and personal hygiene is key to prevention at household level. A high index of suspicion and observing Universal safety precautions is key to prevention at the health facility level. The NCDC wants to remind healthcare workers that they are at a higher risk of contracting Lassa. They are therefore encouraged to ensure strict infection prevention and control practices at points of care. All febrile illnesses must be tested for malaria before treatment; tests that return negative for malaria may be Lassa Fever and must flag suspicion. We encourage frontline health workers to report all suspected cases of Lassa to their Local Government Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers and/or State Epidemiologists.

The threat of a time when antibiotics will fail to serve their roles in combating infectious diseases is currently the biggest fear of the entire global health system. Currently, reports of infections not responding to treatment with antibiotics are stressing countries around the world. Global projections are that resistance will cost the entire world $100Tn by 2050 if nothing is done. It is currently deepening the burden of otherwise treatable diseases including malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and childhood infections. As they contemplate resistance, many countries complain of an inability to provide appropriate access to antibiotics to those who are in dire need of them. These factors coupled with the need to understand the scope of the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, and how best to combat it in Nigeria as a country, formed the basis for the convergence of this multisectorial think tank on antimicrobial resistance. The group met between 16th and 17th of January, 2017 to review Nigeria’s requirement to complete her National Action plan and enroll in the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) of the World Health Organisation. Enrollment on GLASS allows for transparent governance of AMR in countries, as well global assessment of state of the global health system. Key expert recommendations are for countries to ensure a “One Health” and multistakeholder approach in the planning and implementation of their national antimicrobial resistance action planning and strategy. For this reason, participants at the meeting ensured that considerations of Animal Health, the Environment and Human Health were properly factored into all deliberations. Representatives of the Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Nigeria Institute of Pharmaceutical Research (NIPRD), Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, National Veterinary Research Institute and academia participated in the development of a framework for national situation analysis for AMR as well the development of an action plan on AMR for Nigeria. Nigeria’s current commitment to controlling antimicrobial resistance began on the first day of assumption of office by President Muhammad Buhari when he shared this country’s commitment to the global goal of protecting citizens from disease threats. This commitment was strengthened through Nigeria’s participation in World Health Assembly 2015 and the United Nations General Assembly 2016 where Nigeria signed to play her part as a country in combatting AMR. During the last UNGA, Prof Isaac Adewole, Nigeria’s Minister of Health, warned against complacency that could follow the declaration’s adoption: “We must not only talk but act. The time is now to fully implement this document.” In furtherance to this global charge, the Nigerian government immediately appointed the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to take a lead on this initiative of coordinating all relevant national actors to ensure Nigeria fulfills this key milestone before the 70th World Health Assembly in May, 2017. The burden of AMR is primarily due to misuse of antibiotics. The ultimate outcome of this national intervention is to help reduce the heavy burden from resistance by galvanizing Nigerians to use of antibiotics responsibly, to make a more precise assessment of the current situation and burden, and to drive a national capacity building and resource commitment to ensuring the threats of AMR is under check in Nigeria and beyond. According to the Director of Planning, Research & Statistics of the NCDC, Dr. Joshua Obasanya, “We at the NCDC hold ourselves extremely accountable for this coordination effort, our work is to ensure all relevant actors participate in this. We want to make sure that the One Health approach is evident as we combat AMR is Nigeria. This is the only way to ensure our solutions are really sustainable”. One of the technical leads at the meeting, Prof. Iruka Okeke of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Ibadan also added that, “given the enthusiasm experienced during these sessions, I am optimistic that we will meet the required timeline towards a national action plan and AMR surveillance. It is clear, however, that a lot of work needs to be done.

Cases of CSM were first reported in Zamfara State late in 2016. As at March 28 2017, the number of suspected cases reported for the 2016/2017 CSM season stands at 1,966 with the outbreak reaching epidemic proportions in five States- Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina and Niger States. Given the size of the outbreak and the number of States affected, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is leading a multi-agency CSM Outbreak Control Team to coordinate the response. This team includes representatives from the NPHCDA, World Health Organisation, UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control, Médecins Sans Frontières and EHealth Africa. The Outbreak Control Team is focusing on communicating prevention messages, strengthening surveillance, case detection, verification and management as well as communication and coordination across the affected States. NPHCDA is leading a reactive vaccination in Zamfara State, while a similar response is currently being planned in Kebbi and Sokoto States. Vaccines that provide protection to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC) are not commercially available and need to be acquired through a special process managed by WHO. NPHCDA is working closely with WHO to ensure that we get access to vaccines needed to respond to the outbreak and prevent further cases. In addition, UNICEF is currently supporting affected States to scale up social mobilisation focusing on grassroots engagement. Meningitis can be treated if detected early. According to the Chief Executive Officer of the NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, “We understand meningitis peaks every year in the dry season in certain States and we must work better with these States to prevent the unnecessary loss of lives. We must work collectively to stop this outbreak and prevent outbreaks of this scale in the future”. According to the Director of Surveillance at the NCDC, Mrs Olubunmi Ojo, “Immunisation is key to the prevention of meningitis. Between 2011 -2014, the MenAfriVac vaccination campaign against the predominantly circulating Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A in Nigeria then, led to a major reduction in cases recorded from that strain. We now see an outbreak caused predominantly by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (NmC). While reactive vaccination helps to curtail outbreaks, a vaccination campaign against NmC with a long-lasting conjugate vaccine is sorely needed in the region. The NCDC and its partner agencies and institutions at the Federal Ministry of Health will continue to work closely with States and we believe that our concerted efforts will bring this outbreak under control, as we also work towards preventing outbreaks of this scale in the future. History of Meningitis Outbreaks in Nigeria: As one of the countries within the Meningitis Belt, Nigeria has recorded outbreaks in the past. Until recently these outbreaks were caused mostly by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmA). These outbreaks occur in the dry season, due to its low humidity and dusty conditions and usually ends with the onset of the rainy season. The introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac), led to the decline of NmA cases and outbreaks caused by NmA epidemics have been virtually eliminated. However, we now seem to be seeing a phenomenon called “serotype replacement” - an increase in the cases and outbreaks caused by other Nm serogroups such as W, X, and C. From 2013 to 2016, Nigeria has seen increasing cases of meningitis in adjacent Sokoto and Kebbi States caused by a new strain of N. meningitidis serogroup C (NmC). Understanding Meningitis: Our brains and spinal cords are covered by membranes called meninges; they help to protect these delicate organs from infection and even direct physical injury. The infection of the meninges by microorganisms such as bacteria or viruses results in the condition known as meningitis. Viral and bacterial infections are the most common cause but bacterial meningitis is much more serious due to its rapid onset and its significant risk of death. Neisseria meningitidis can be carried in the throat and sometimes, for reasons not fully understood, can overwhelm the body's defences allowing infection to spread through the bloodstream to the brain. It is believed that 10% to 20% of the population carries Neisseria meningitidis in their throats at any given time but the carriage rate may be higher in epidemic situations. The most common symptoms of meningitis are stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting, and anyone with the symptoms above is advised to urgently seek care at the nearest health facility. Meningitis should always be viewed as a medical emergency.", "date_published": "Thursday, March 30, 2017", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:51"}

The outbreak has been in constant decline for eight weeks and the affected States have recorded much fewer new cases. In the last four weeks, no Local Government Area has reached outbreak alert threshold. By the 16th of June 2017 when the EOC was stepped down, a total of 14,518 suspected cases of meningitis were reported from 25 states, with 1,166 deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 8%. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) and partner organizations worked assiduously to reduce the impact of the outbreak on affected communities. The NCDC established a National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) which coordinated the national outbreak response. This included the deployment of Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to the most affected States to strengthen surveillance, case management, laboratory capacity and risk communication. The planning process to prevent future outbreaks and ensuring better preparedness for the next epidemic season has begun. Laboratory capacity has been improved with the recent operationalisation of the new National Reference Laboratory in Gaduwa, Abuja with support from the Federal Ministry of Health, the US CDC and the World Health Organisation. NCDC is also coordinating a network of laboratories across the country to improve case confirmation capacity. National guidelines towards responding to future outbreaks are being developed together with ongoing continuous awareness campaigns, keeping the general public informed. Workshops to improve preparedness are also being organized. Reactive vaccination campaigns led by the NPHCDA were successfully conducted in Zamfara, Sokoto, Yobe and Katsina States. The state governments were fully engaged in conducting these campaigns to ensure that the vaccines reached the most at-risk population. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, Chief Executive Officer of the NCDC said “While NCDC has stepped down the Emergency response, the work never stops – we will continue to work 24/7 to ensure the protection of all Nigerians against infectious disease threats.

The campaign started on the 6th of April 2017 in the eight most affected Local Government Areas in Zamfara State, and will continue until April 9, 2017. The campaign targets 300,000 persons aged 2 – 29 years. More campaigns are planned in other States in the near future. Ahead of the vaccination campaign, the Zamfara State government, worked with the Federal Ministry of Health, NPHCDA, NCDC and other global partners on an intensive sensitization exercise to increase community participation in the vaccination campaign. The team of experts is tasked with planning, coordinating and implementing an effective vaccination campaign in collaboration with the recently commissioned Meningitis Emergency Operations Centre at NCDC. Reports from the field indicate early progress in the vaccination exercise. In Zamfara State, there has been a massive turnout recorded in the target Local Government Areas. The Secretary to the State Government of Zamfara and Chairman of the Zamfara State Committee for the Control of Meningitis, Prof. Abdullahi Shinkafi, is coordinating oversight of the vaccination exercise, in close collaboration with the NCDC Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, who is leading an NCDC technical team to monitor and supervise the campaign. Traditional leaders and several community groups are helping with mobilization of people across the State. According to Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, “the commitment of the traditional rulers has been evident here; they have helped mobilize their community members for this exercise. Indeed we see an opportunity for a sustainable initiative which will go beyond this response.” To support effective outbreak response coordination across the entire country, the Honourable Minister of Health mandated the NCDC to activate an Emergency Operations Centre which has swung into action. The Centre is currently staffed with experts from the NCDC, NPCHDA, the Federal Ministry of Health and others from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, UNICEF and other partner agencies.

The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) continue to lead the Federal Government response to the outbreak, with activities focused on four key outbreak response and control areas. These include raising awareness of the outbreak in communities, implementing enhanced surveillance to quickly detect and report new cases, vaccinating populations at the highest risk and treating persons diagnosed with the disease, as well as outbreak preparation in LGAs and states at risk for the outbreak. As at April 17, 2017, 8,057 suspected cases of meningitis have been reported across the country; 230 (3%) were laboratory confirmed. A total of 745 deaths (9.2%) have been recorded. Of the 8,057 cases, 7,519 (93% of cases) have occurred in the five states that have reached outbreak levels for Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM) serotype C. To increase awareness of the outbreak and coordinate response across states, the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee on Primary Health Care convened a meeting of governors and traditional leaders from all Northern Nigerian states. The meeting, held in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and its agencies, and international partners focused on strategies to end the outbreak. State governors reaffirmed their commitment to immediate and concrete actions towards halting the outbreak. The traditional leaders also committed to continued awareness-raising in their communities and jurisdictions. At national level and in affected states, activities aimed at driving information into grassroots —including advocacy meetings with religious leaders, civil society organizations, health professionals, entertainers and media organizations – continue. Enhanced surveillance activities activated by several states in partnership with NCDC and partners have contributed to increased case finding and more timely reporting. NCDC Rapid Response Teams of trained doctors and scientists continue to provide on-site outbreak investigation and control support to affected states. The NPHCDA successfully led vaccination in Zamfara and in Katsina targeting persons between ages 2 – 29 years in the priority LGAs in both states. Preparations are at advanced stages for the next round of vaccination in priority wards and local government areas in Sokoto State. Distribution of medicines and other essential commodities to treat persons with meningitis in key affected states is also ongoing.

The cumulative number of suspected cases recorded in Nigeria throughout the outbreak period is now 9,646 and 839 deaths from 43 Local Government Areas in 23 states. However, only five states have at least one LGA over the outbreak threshold, down from six last week. While the total number of suspected cases will rise with each new case, the number of new cases recorded per week is dropping in the affected States indicating that the outbreak is likely to have peaked. We expect a continued decline in the number of new cases with the intensification of control measures in the affected states. The Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) says this recent assessment is indicative of the positive impact of current national and state interventions being coordinated by the EOC. According to the Incident Manager, “…these numbers are encouraging but it is too early to celebrate. We will continue to intensify the interventions in order to ensure that we effectively control this outbreak”. The national response has identified the need to provide technical support to all affected States in the areas of case management, epidemiology and risk communication.

In addition, there is an increased risk of contamination of water supply, and contact with the contaminated flood which supports the transmission of infectious diseases and can lead to outbreaks. Flood also provides a breeding ground for disease vectors. Since the beginning of July 2017, Nigeria has experienced flooding in 16 states. This has resulted in the destruction of properties, injuries, and deaths. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) is constantly monitoring the situation by issuing regular flood alerts. This year’s Annual Flood Outlook has determined that about 30 states and 100 local government areas are deemed to be high flood risk areas. To reduce the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever and poliomyelitis; and vector-borne diseases such as malaria and yellow fever during flooding, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises that precautionary measures should be taken, and offers the following advice to Nigerians; •Do not drink flood water, or use it to wash dishes, brush teeth, or wash/prepare food •Communities should ensure chlorination of the public source of water supply •Ensure proper disposal of waste and clearing of sewage •Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water •Discard all medicines, food and bottled water contaminated by flood water. •In homes, ensure water is well boiled before drinking •Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping •Avoid mosquito bites by using an Insecticide Treated Net •Ensure safe food preparation techniques •If you experience sudden fever or diarrhea, please visit a health care facility immediately •Health workers should observe universal care precautions at all times Contacts NCDC toll-free number: 0800-970000-10 SMS 08099555577 Whatsapp 07087110839.

While Cholera is endemic in Nigeria, there is an increase in number of cases during the rainy season, usually between April and September. Cholera is most often spread by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated with stools of infected persons. Food, particularly when undercooked, can be contaminated by water containing the bacteria or if it is handled by an infected person. Cholera transmission is more common in areas with overcrowding, poor sanitation and hygiene practices, and lack of clean food and water. Most people who have been infected may not show symptoms or have mild symptoms. However, the bacteria causing the disease can be shed in their faeces, leading to further spread of the disease. Cholera is characterized by sudden onset of severe acute watery diarrhea, which can lead to death as a result of dehydration and to rapid death if not managed. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness. This year, there have been confirmed outbreaks of Cholera in Kwara, Zamfara, Lagos, Kebbi, Oyo, Kano and Borno States. The incidence of flooding in some areas has increased the risk for Cholera in many States as the rains continue. To reduce the spread of Cholera, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises that precautionary measures should be taken, and offers the following advice to Nigerians: •Ensure all food is well cooked before consumption •Avoid raw foods such as fruits and vegetables, except you have washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself •Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available •Ensure water is well boiled before drinking and bottled water is properly sealed •Store boiled water in a clean and safe container •Ensure proper disposal of waste and clearing of sewage •Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping •If you experience sudden diarrhea, please visit a health care facility immediately •Report/take all sick persons with the signs or symptoms above to a health care facility immediately •Health workers should observe universal precautions at all times to aid infection control The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control’s Rapid Response Team has been deployed to provide support to affected States and has also supported States with the provision of cholera response kits. States are encouraged to ensure early reporting, adequate preparedness including provision of medical supplies, and institute proper case management practices.

As at the 9th of August 2017, Lagos State had reported five confirmed cases and two deaths. Following the confirmation of these cases, the public health response commenced immediately led by the Lagos State Ministry of Health with support from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Contact identification and tracing was initiated, and case management has begun for other confirmed cases. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has provided resources including medical supplies to support case management in the State. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic illness, caused by contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. The Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever. The illness is characterized by sudden onset of fever, and general weakness. Other symptoms including headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. In the most severe cases, individuals may bleed from the mouth, nose, eyes or other parts of the body. Although there is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever, the disease can be prevented and treated. Members of the public are advised to ensure proper sanitation to discourage rats from entering homes. Food stuff should be stored on rodent-proof containers, garbage should be disposed properly and far from the home, and hand washing should be practiced frequently. It is very important to report to a health facility for early initiation of treatment. Lassa fever should be suspected where common causes if fever, like malaria have been ruled out. Health care workers are strongly advised to practice universal care precautions while handling patients at all times, not just when Lassa is suspected. Extra caution should be taken by family members who are providing care for patients with Lassa fever. In addition, States are encouraged to ensure safe burial practices for patients who die from Lassa fever. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control urges all States to continue to report cases of Lassa fever immediately, while improving on the timeliness of their reporting generally. National guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control, as well as Lassa fever case management have been developed and are available of the NCDC website for download (http://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines). Since the onset of the Lassa Fever outbreak in December 2016 (Week 49), a total of 689 suspected cases and 113 deaths have been reported as at Week 31 of 2017. Of these, two hundred and thirty one cases (231) have been classified as: confirmed (217) with 81 deaths. NCDC has been supporting the response across several States in Nigeria and will shortly host an outbreak review meeting to review critical aspects relating to the outbreak in Nigeria.

The Bayelsa State Ministry of Health initiated an outbreak investigation and response, supported by a team from NCDC, which was immediately deployed to the state. As at 13th of October 2017, there were 17 SUSPECTED cases reported from Yenagoa LGA in Bayelsa State. We have received laboratory confirmation for Monkeypox virus from three of these cases from the WHO Regional Laboratory in Dakar, Senegal. Samples from 12 others from Bayelsa were negative, and we are awaiting two results. With these results, the Monkeypox outbreak in Yenagoa has been confirmed with laboratory evidence. The most likely source of infection is a primary zoonotic transmission, from an animal, with secondary person-to-person transmission. Since our initial announcement, a total of 43 other SUSPECTED cases have been reported from eight other States (Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Ekiti, Lagos, Enugu, Nasarawa, Rivers, and FCT). Of these, four cases from Lagos have also been tested and confirmed to be negative for the Monkeypox virus. We expect that many of these cases being reported from other states in Nigeria are not caused by the Monkeypox virus, but we will continue to investigate all those cases that fit the case definition. Further laboratory tests using whole genome sequencing are being carried out by the Africa Centre for Genomics and Infectious Diseases in Redeemers University Ede, Ogun State. Monkeypox is largely a self-limiting disease, from which all suspected patients that have been reported to date are doing well clinically. Even before this confirmation, all the necessary public health measures have been put in place and will continue to be implemented. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has established an Emergency Operations Centre and will continue to co-ordinate the response across States and test samples from other cases. NCDC will also continue to support all states in their response and will keep the public informed as the situation evolves. Measures that can be taken to prevent infection with Monkeypox virus include avoiding contact with squirrels, rats and similar animals, especially when these animals are sick or found dead in areas where the Monkeypox virus is circulating. The public is advised to always wash hands with soap and water after contact with animals or when caring for sick relatives. Monkeypox begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion before the rash on face, palms and soles appears and lymph nodes swell (lymphadenopathy). The incubation period (time from infection to symptoms) for is usually 7-14 days but can range from 5-21 days. Nigerians are advised to remain calm and supportive of public health authorities, avoid self-medication and report to the nearest health facility if feeling unwell or notice any of the above symptoms in anyone around you. It is important to note that there has been no confirmation of Monkeypox in any other part of the country, and it is likely that many of the other cases being reported are not caused by the Monkeypox virus. Nigerians should continue to be vigilant at all times. Health care workers are strongly advised to always practice universal precautions while handling patients and/or body fluids at all times. They are also urged to be alert, be familiar with the symptoms of Monkeypox and maintain a high index of suspicion. All suspected cases should be immediately reported to the Local Government Area or State Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers.

Subsequently, 11 other cases were identified. All the cases are currently receiving appropriate medical care. All the patients are improving clinically and there have been no deaths. As at 1st October 2017, 32 close contacts of the cases have been identified, advised appropriately and are being monitored. A Rapid Response Team from NCDC was immediately deployed to support the Bayelsa State Government in the investigations and public health response to the outbreak. The team has been supporting the Bayelsa State Department of Public Health and the State Epidemiologist to respond to the outbreak. As the outbreak investigation and response continues, the Bayelsa State Government has started an aggressive public enlightenment campaign to advise clinicians and the public on the symptoms of the disease and the steps required to manage the cases and to prevent further spread. NCDC has also collected appropriate clinical samples from the cases and these are being analysed through the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja. Monkeypox infection is a relatively rare disease that has previously been reported in Nigeria in the 1970s. It is primarily a zoonotic infection i.e. transmitted primarily from animals to humans, with limited subsequent person-to-person transmission. The most common animal hosts are squirrels, rats and sometimes, monkeys. The Monkeypox virus can cause an illness with the following symptoms; a generalised vesicular skin rash, fever, and painful jaw swelling. In previous outbreaks, it has led to death in about 1-10% of infected cases. Although there is no specific medicine to treat the disease, when intensive supportive care is provided most patients recover fully. Measures that can be taken to prevent infection with Monkeypox virus include avoiding contact with the animals listed above, especially animals that are sick or found dead in areas where Monkeypox occurs. The public is advised to always wash hands with soap and water after contact with animals or when caring for sick relatives humans or soiled beddings. Nigerians are advised to remain calm and supportive of public health authorities, avoid self-medication and report to the nearest health facility if feeling unwell or notice any of the above symptoms in anyone around you. Health care workers are strongly advised to practice universal precautions while handling patients and/or body fluids at all times. They are also urged to be alert, be familiar with the symptoms and maintain a high index of suspicion. All suspected cases should be reported to the Local Government Area or State Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers. The Chief Executive Officer of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu has advised that health workers must continue to manage their patients without fear.

It was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has been found to occur sporadically in other parts of Africa, including Nigeria. It is normally spread by direct contact with bodily fluids (blood, secretions) or mucosal lesions of infected animals such as monkeys and rodents (squirrels, bush meat). Human-to-human transmission can occur following contact with infected respiratory tract secretions or skin lesions of an infected person or objects recently contaminated by patient fluids or lesion materials. It can also spread from mother to child through the placenta (congenital monkeypox). The illness is characterized by fever, headache, body aches, feeling tired, swollen lymph nodes and its characteristic rash. About 1 to 3 days of fever, the rash erupts, beginning on the face and then spreading to the body with the face and palms/soles being most affected. This mostly self-limiting illness often lasts for 2−4 weeks. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been supporting the Bayelsa State Government to carry out measures to control the spread of the disease including actively searching for cases, isolation of identified cases, contact tracing, laboratory support and increasing disease awareness in the community and among health care workers. To prevent Monkeypox, members of the public are advised to ●Avoid contact with wildlife (bushmeat) especially those found sick or dead especially in the area affected by the Monkeypox outbreak, i.e. Bayelsa. ●Avoid close physical contact with persons infected with Monkeypox. ●Wash hands with soap and water after caring for or visiting sick people. ●Cooking all animal food products properly before eating. ●Appropriate protective clothing and gloves should be worn while handling sick animals or their infected tissues and during slaughtering procedures. ●Report all cases with the above-mentioned symptoms to the nearest health facility for care.  Healthcare workers: ●Health care workers are strongly advised to always practice universal standard care precautions (including droplet precautions) when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. ●Wash hands with soap and water after contact with patients and/or their environment. ●Maintain a high index of suspicion for Monkeypox especially for patients presenting with fever and vesicular/pustular rash in areas with reported outbreaks. ●During triage, use precautionary measures such as placing a surgical mask over the nose and mouth of suspected patients and covering any exposed skin lesions with a sheet or gown. ● Isolate all patients suspected of having Monkeypox as soon as possible. ●Wear personal protective equipment (gloves, gown and masks) before close contact with suspected cases and dispose properly. ●Correctly disinfect all contaminated equipment (including bedding) using bleach unless otherwise indicated and dispose all waste properly. ●Samples taken from humans for investigation of Monkeypox virus be handled by trained staff and sent to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. ●Report all cases to the State Epidemiologist/LGA Public Health Department immediately  Contacts NCDC toll-free number: 0800-970000-10 SMS 08099555577, Whatsapp 07087110839, Twitter/Facebook: @NCDCgov SIGNED MANAGEMENT", "date_published": "Friday, October 06, 2017", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:52"}

NO CASE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED but Samples have been collected from each suspected case for laboratory confirmation. Results are still awaited. So far, there have been no deaths recorded. It is unlikely that many of the suspected cases are actually monkeypox, but all are being investigated. All the suspected cases are currently receiving appropriate medical care, and the patients are all improving clinically in their various States. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is supporting the affected States to ensure the outbreak is brought under control and to limit further spread. NCDC has activated an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) to coordinate the outbreak investigation and response across the affected States. The EOC is currently supporting State Ministries of Health in their response to the outbreak through active case finding, epidemiological investigation and contact tracing. Measures have been put in place to ensure effective sample collection and testing to enable laboratory confirmation. Risk communication activities have been heightened to advise the public on preventive measures. All 36 States and the FCT have been notified for preparedness. In light of the above, it is important to be reminded that monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease with symptoms in humans similar to those seen in smallpox patients, but much less severe and with a low fatality rate. Transmission is via contact with infected animal, human, or contaminated materials. Animal-to-human transmission occurs through bite or scratch from animals and bush meat preparation. It can also be transmitted from one person to another. Human-to-human transmission occurs through respiratory droplets, contact with infected persons or contaminated materials. Control measures include isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, strict adherence to universal precautions, especially frequent handwashing with soap and water, and use of personal protective equipment. Signs and symptoms include fever, headache, body pain, malaise, lymphadenopathy (enlargement of glands), sore throat, the characteristic generalized vesicular rash. The rashes might last between two to four weeks. Monkeypox is self-limiting, which means patients tend to recover with time. However, supportive care and management of condition is required and mostly successful. The CEO, of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Contriol, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu again emphasizes that “Nigerians are once advised to remain calm, avoid self-medication and report any suspected case to the nearest health facility. Public health authorities across the country have been well informed on what to do when a suspected case arrises”.

Antibiotic resistance is accelerated by misuse of antibiotics, which is a major problem in Nigeria. As at 2014, the O’Neill report estimated that about 10 million people will die from AMR annually by 2050 if current trends continue; 40% of these deaths will occur in Africa. Therefore, tackling antibiotic resistance is a high priority task for Nigeria. In response to this emerging crisis, the 68th World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2015 adopted a Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance in collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The plan outlines five key strategic objectives to be met as the response to control AMR through a “one health” approach. In line with the WHA resolution, The Honorable Minister of Health approved the establishment of Nigeria’s National AMR Coordinating Body at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on the 26th of November 2016. A National AMR Technical Working Group (AMR-TWG) was created comprising of stakeholders from human health, animal health, food production and environment sectors. The AMR-TWG conducted a situation analysis of AMR in Nigeria and developed a National Action Plan for AMR containment in the country. Nigeria has also enrolled in the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) developed by WHO to support the Global Action Plan on AMR As part of the implementation of Strategic Objective 1 of the Global Action Plan, to improve awareness about antimicrobial resistance, and in line with Nigeria’s National Action Plan on AMR, the WHO is coordinating the World Antibiotic Awareness Week tagged ‘Antibiotics: Handle with care’ global campaign. This week-long event raises awareness on Antibiotic resistance and encourages best practices among the public, policymakers, health, agriculture and environmental professionals. To close the week, the NCDC in collaboration with various partners is organizing a one-day symposium on AMR themed “Combating AMR through research and awareness” on the 16th November 2017.

Understanding the AMR situation in Nigeria will provide an excellent case study of the challenges faced by low-income countries. Methods The information was derived from review of reports, programmatic data and documents, literature search, key informant interviews and a series of systematic reviews. Data was entered into purpose-built templates and synthesized thematically. Results In Nigeria, the ratio of licensed pharmacies to over-the-counter medicine stores was 15 to 1 in 2016. A systematic review determined that median prevalence of persons using antibiotics without prescription to be 46.8%. In animals, antibiotics such as tetracyclines constituted over 80% of antimicrobials sold or used in 2014 and 2015. Antibiotic resistance was documented in humans, to drugs recommended by the country’s treatment guidelines for commonly occurring infections such as cholera and cerebrospinal meningitis. Majority of the studies documented recovery of E. coli, non-typhoidal Salmonella and antibiotic residues from livestock, pets and animal products, most commonly in poultry. The drivers of AMR included unregulated antibiotic sales, proliferation of unlicensed medicine stores, shortage of licensed prescribers, poor AMR awareness and use of antibiotics in animals without prescription. Conclusion We recommend that the government enforce regulations on antibiotic sales of antibiotics to humans and animals and increase awareness on AMR in Nigerian communities. Identified gaps from the were used to develop a National Action Plan for AMR.

Yellow Fever transmission is more common in tropical areas, regions with poor sanitation and hygiene practices, and parts of stagnant water (which is a breeding site for mosquitoes). Nigeria falls within the Yellow fever belt Most infected people do not experience symptoms. However, when these occur, symptoms include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue and could vary from mild to severe. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days. In severe cases, bleeding may occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach and could present as vomiting blood or passing very dark stools. Yellow fever can be prevented by administration of the Yellow fever vaccine which is available in health facilities and confers lifelong protection. Although there is no specific medicine to treat the disease, intensive supportive care can be provided. Most patients would recover with appropriate care.  To reduce the spread of Yellow fever in the country following the confirmation of one case in Kwara State, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control advise that standard precautionary measures should be taken by healthcare workers and offers the following advice to Nigerians: •Ensure that you get vaccinated against Yellow fever. A single dose of Yellow fever vaccine, which is included in Nigeria’s routine immunization schedule given at nine-months is free and sufficient to confer lifelong protection. •Use insecticides or insect repellent to avoid mosquito bites •Wear protective clothing to reduce mosquito bites •Destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes by eliminating standing water and shade in your environment. •Sleep under a long-lasting insecticide-treated net •Ensure proper sanitation by getting rid of stagnant water or breeding space for mosquitoes •Health care workers are strongly advised to practice standard care precautions while handling patients at all times •Health workers are urged to be alert and maintain a high index of suspicion. Since confirmation, the State Epidemiology Team has been working with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), National Arbovirus and Vectors Research Centre (NAVRC), World Health Organisation (WHO) Country Office and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in carrying out a detailed investigation and risk analysis. A multi-agency Incident Management System has also been constituted at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to ensure a rapid and coordinated response.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/117/health-advisory-on-lassa-fever-%28healthcare-workers%29", "title": "Health Advisory on Lassa Fever (Healthcare Workers)", "body": "Lassa fever is a viral infection caused by the Lassa fever virus. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with excreta from rats. The disease occurs throughout the year, but more cases are recorded during the dry season. Lassa fever is spread through: •Direct contact with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. •Eating food or drinking water contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats. •Person-to-person through contact with blood, urine, saliva, throat secretion or semen of an infected person. •Touching of floors, beddings and household materials contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats or an infected person. •Inhalation of air contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats or an infected person. Prevention and Control Presently, there is no vaccine against Lassa fever. To reduce the spread of Lassa fever in the country, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advices that standard precautionary measures should be taken by healthcare workers and offers the following advice: •Maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever. •All cases of fever must be tested for malaria using appropriate diagnostic tools e.g. rapid diagnostic kit (RDT). If the result is negative and other common causes of fever are ruled out, healthcare workers should suspect Lassa fever. •Isolate all suspected cases of Lassa fever and contact the appropriate authorities (LGA Disease Surveillance and Notification Officer (DSNO) or State Epidemiologists. Health care workers are strongly advised to always practice universal standard care precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately arrange for laboratory testing and report to the Local Government disease surveillance and notification officers (DSNOs). It is important to note the following while caring for Lassa Fever patients: •Limit the number of health facility staff and visitors in the patient’s room. •Ensure proper wearing and removal of full personal protective equipment (face masks, hand gloves, gowns, and goggles) before and after entering the patient’s room. •Wash hands with soap under running water always. •Limit invasive procedures and use of injectable medications. •Appropriate disposal and disinfection of items used by Lassa fever patients such as syringes, thermometers, beddings, clothing, cups, plates, spoons, etc. •Observe safe disposal of injectables and other sharp items. •The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be suspected in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic or when common causes of fever such as malaria have been ruled out. •Samples taken from suspected patients for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be safely handled by trained staff and transported promptly to approved laboratories. •Observe safe burial practices. People at risk include: •People of all age groups who come in contact with the urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats or persons. •People living in dirty environment. Dirt attracts rats. •Family members who are taking care of persons infected with Lassa fever. Health workers, including; oDoctors, nurses or other health workers providing direct patient care, without universal precautions. oHospital staff who clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies. oLaboratory staff who handle blood samples from suspected Lassa fever cases. oMedical or support staff who prepare or handle dead bodies of Lassa fever patients. Signs and symptoms Symptoms appear 2 to 21 days after contact with the Lassa fever virus. The symptoms of the disease usually start with a fever and general body weakness. Other symptoms include: High fever (38.5oC or above), sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, restlessness, swelling of the face, bleeding through body openings (nose, ears, eyes, mouth, etc.) Treatment Lassa fever can be treated. Early presentation to a healthcare facility increases the chances of survival. Contacts NCDC toll-free number: 0800-970000-10 SMS 08099555577 Whatsapp 07087110839.

The Honourable Minister of State for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire has announced laboratory confirmation of six additional cases among the suspected cases for Monkeypox. These include two cases each in Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom States, one in Enugu State and one in the Federal Capital Territory. With this, there are nine confirmed cases of Monkeypox in Nigeria. Announcing this in his office today, Dr. Ehanire noted that investigations are on-going to see if any of the new cases has a link with the Bayelsa cluster, where the outbreak started. He called for calm among members of the public, as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is working with all affected States to ensure case finding and adequate management. He added that as frightening as the manifestation of the ailment may seem, no fatality has been recorded to date. As at the 25th of October 2017, a total of 94 suspected cases have been reported from 11 States (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Ekiti, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Rivers) and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). He noted that the newly confirmed cases are patients already being managed by public health authorities and have been receiving appropriate clinical care since onset of the illness. The Federal Ministry of Health, through the NCDC, is in close contact with all State Epidemiology Teams, as well as the health facilities providing clinical care to both suspected and confirmed cases. State Commissioners of Health have been advised to place all health care facilities and Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers on alert, to ensure early case detection, reporting and effective treatment. A National-level Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) led by the NCDC with support from our development partners, is coordinating outbreak investigation and response across affected States. The EOC includes the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, as well as experts from partner agencies. The EOC provides daily support to State Ministries of Health in active case finding, epidemiological investigation, contact tracing, case management, psychosocial support and risk communication. The NCDC has also deployed Rapid Response Teams to the four States with confirmed cases. Measures have been put in place to ensure proper investigation of all reported cases, effective sample collection and testing, as well as case management of all suspected and confirmed cases. Risk communication activities have been heightened to advise the public as well as healthcare workers on preventive measures. A nationwide communications campaign has begun, to inform Nigerians of key preventive measures to take to curtail the further spread of monkeypox. The NCDC has been working with poxvirus experts from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that every available step is taken to trace how this outbreak may be spreading, and in understanding the links between case clusters, in order to prevent further spread. An Interim National Guideline for Monkeypox has been developed and disseminated to all States for coordination of response activities. This is also available via http://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/docs/protocols/50_1508912430.pdf. Monkeypox is a largely self-limiting disease i.e. a disease that resolves itself. Generalised vesicular skin rashes, fever, and painful jaw swelling are characteristic symptoms associated with an infection. Although there is no specific medicine to treat the disease, when intensive supportive care is provided virtually all patients recover fully, as we have seen with the current outbreak. It is thought that people could get Monkeypox if they are bitten or scratched by an animal, or contact animal blood in preparing bushmeat or have contact with an infected animal’s body fluids or sores. Monkeypox may also be spread between people through prolonged face-to-face contact, or through contact with body fluids or sores of an infected person, or items that have been contaminated with fluids or sores (clothing, bedding, etc.), Ehanire said. Measures that can be taken to prevent infection with Monkeypox virus include avoiding contact with animals that could carry the virus such as rodents and bushmeat, especially animals that appear sick or were found dead in areas where Monkeypox occurs. The public is advised to always wash hands with soap and water after contact with animals or, when caring for sick relatives, or managing soiled beddings. Nigerians are once again advised to remain calm and supportive of public health authorities, avoid self-medication and report to the nearest health facility if feeling unwell or notice any of the above symptoms in anyone around you. It is important to reiterate that supportive care can be provided and full recovery is mostly the case. Health care workers are strongly advised to take prescribed universal precautions while handling patients and/or body fluids at all times. They are also urged to be alert, be familiar with the symptoms and maintain a high index of suspicion. They are urged to adhere to guidelines stated in the Interim National Guideline for Monkeypox, and to report all suspected cases to the Local Government Area or State Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers (DSNOs).

At an event tagged “Idea To Reality”, the document detailing the strategy was launched by the Honourable Minister for Health, Professor Isaac Adewole. As a platform to closely monitor and support the work of the NCDC, the 2017-2021 strategic plan seeks to create a strong vision for the NCDC underpinned by clearly defined principles and supported by well-articulated implementation and delivery plans. Under the mandate of the current leadership of the NCDC, activities started in late 2016 to collaboratively develop a 2017–2021 strategic plan, incorporating a new vision and mission to guide activities. The new vision for the NCDC agreed after a series of staff and stakeholder consultations is: “A healthier and safer Nigeria through the prevention and control of diseases of public health importance”; this cascades into a mission Statement, which is further broken down into five key strategic goals with defined outcomes, 22 objectives and 89 corresponding activities for the 2017–2021 horizon. In addition, a performance management structure has been instituted to oversee and coordinate the execution of the multiple initiatives, as well as evaluate the progress made towards achieving the strategic goals. Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is Nigeria’s national public health institute with the mandate to provide a healthier and safer Nigeria through the prevention and control of diseases of public health importance. It is focused on protecting the health of Nigerians through evidence based prevention, integrated disease surveillance and response activities, using a one-health approach, guided by research and led by a skilled workforce. Five key strategic goals guiding activities of the NCDC are: •Accurately measure the burden of infectious diseases in  Nigeria. •Ensure Nigeria meets its international obligations under the  International Health Regulations. •Develop a Public Health Laboratory network to support  the detection, prevention and response to critical infectious  diseases. •Reduce the adverse impact of predictable and unpredicted  public health emergencies. •Create an efficiently managed and evidence-based organisation with a clear focus on health promotion and disease prevention. NCDC is also the host for the ECOWAS Regional Centre for Disease Control (RCDC) and the regional hub for the Africa Centres for Disease Control (ACDC). The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) appreciates the Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole; the Honourable Minister of State for Health - Dr Osagie Ehanire; the Permanent Secretary; Directors and colleagues at the Federal Ministry of Health for their continued support of NCDC. NCDC also thanks the past Ministers of Health and the pioneer Chief Executive Officer of the NCDC, Professor Abdulsalami Nasidi, for the firm foundation laid upon which this strategic plan is built. NCDC is grateful to all partners, particularly the Tony Blair Institute, African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) and Dr. Ebere Okereke who supported the development of this plan, and the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centers of Disease Control (CDC) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for their support and partnership. The Chief Executive Officer of the NCDC said “Our vision is to build the confidence of Nigerians and the global community in the NCDC in our preparedness to protect the health of citizens through information, inclusion and timely response to health concerns. We are ready to take on the task ahead, working in partnership with the Nigerian people. We assure you that we will give all it takes to strengthen our contribution to improving public health in Nigeria.

It is a very serious infection that can sometimes lead to fatal consequences. CSM remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, with 26 States in Nigeria within this belt. Large outbreaks can occur during the dry season (i.e November through May). CSM is contagious and can be transmitted through tiny droplets of respiratory secretions from an infected person, during close contact such as coughing or sneezing. The disease is more common among persons aged less than 15 years and deaths are higher among untreated cases. Signs and symptoms include sudden high fever, loss of appetite, stiff neck, severe headache, sensitivity to light, difficulty concentrating, and convulsions. CSM can be prevented by: •Avoiding overcrowded places and ensuring adequate ventilation in the home. •Covering the nose and mouth with a disposable tissue when sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose and disposing used tissues promptly into a waste bin. •Minimising contact with droplets when such as turning the head away from people coughing and sneezing. •Washing your hands frequently especially after coughing or sneezing. •Visiting the health facility if you notice anyone with symptoms of CSM. •Ensuring vaccination where available •Practicing universal care precautions at all times: i.e. wearing gloves, while handling patients or providing care to an ill relative. During epidemics, reactive vaccination campaigns can be used to prevent the spread of the disease. It is important to report to a health facility immediately if you experience any of the signs or symptoms listed above. Early presentation to a health facility and treatment, increases chances of survival.

The EOC has deployed Rapid Response Teams to the most affected States- Ebonyi, Ondo and Edo States. The RRTs are supporting the States in response coordination, contact tracing, case management, risk communication and strengthening infection prevention and control practices. Emergency supplies have also been sent to treatment centres in all affected States. Since the beginning of 2018, a total number of 107 suspected Lassa fever cases have been recorded in ten States: Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo and Lagos States. As at 21st January 2018, the total number of confirmed cases is 61, with 16 deaths recorded. Ten health care workers have been infected in four States (Ebonyi - 7, Nasarawa - 1, Kogi - 1 and Benue - 1) with three deaths in Ebonyi State. NCDC is collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, African Field Epidemiology Network, US Centers for Disease Control, University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and other agencies, in supporting the response in the affected States. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Health care workers in health facilities are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, especially where infection prevention and control procedures are not strictly adhered to. Lassa fever can be prevented through practicing good personal hygiene and proper environmental sanitation. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households, and other measures to discourage rodents from entering homes. Hand washing should be practiced frequently. Health care workers are again reminded that Lassa fever presents initially like any other disease causing a febrile illness such as malaria; and are advised to practice standard precautions at all times, maintaining a high index of suspicion. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) must be applied to all suspected cases of malaria. When the RDT is negative, other causes of febrile illness including Lassa fever should be considered. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment increase the chances of survival. Family members who are providing care for patients with Lassa fever should take extra caution. In addition, States are encouraged to ensure safe and dignified burial practices for patients who die from Lassa fever. The National guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control, as well as Lassa fever case management have been developed, disseminated to States and are available on the NCDC website for download (http://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines).

Three of the four cases have subsequently passed away. The Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole, immediately requested that NCDC provides support to the Government of Ebonyi State, to investigate and respond to this cluster of cases. Following the report, the Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) immediately commenced the public health response, supporting the Ebonyi State Ministry of Health. A Rapid Response Team has been immediately deployed from NCDC to support the State in response coordination, contact tracing, case management and strengthening infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures. The NCDC has also provided urgently required medical supplies and drugs to support case management in the State. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease, caused by contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. The Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever. According to the Chief Executive Officer of the NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, ‘Health care workers in health facilities are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, especially where infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures are not strictly adhered to. We therefore strongly advise that health care workers practice universal care precautions while handling patients at all times, not just when Lassa fever is suspected. We commiserate with the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki (FETHA) and Ebonyi State Government, and will support them to avert a future occurrence’. Although there is no vaccine currently available for Lassa fever, the disease can be prevented. Members of the public are advised to keep their environments clean in order to discourage rats from entering homes. Food stuff should be stored in rodent-proof containers, garbage should be disposed properly and far from the home, and hand washing should be practiced frequently. Health care workers are again reminded that Lassa fever presents initially like any other disease causing a febrile illness such as malaria; and are advised to practice universal care precautions at all times.

The virus is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with excreta from rats. The disease occurs throughout the year, but more cases are recorded during the dry season. Lassa fever is spread through: •Direct contact with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. •Eating food or drinking water contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. •From person-to-person through contact with blood, urine, saliva, throat secretion or semen of an infected person. •Touching of floors, beddings and household materials contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats or an infected person. People most at risk include: •People of all age groups who come in contact with the urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats. •People living in dirty environments. •Family members who are taking care of persons infected with Lassa fever •Health workers, including; oDoctors, nurses or other health workers providing direct patient care, without universal precautions. oHospital staff who clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies. oLaboratory staff who handle blood samples from suspected Lassa fever cases. oMedical or support staff who prepare or handle dead bodies of Lassa fever patients without appropriate precautions. Signs and symptoms Symptoms appear 2 to 21 days after contact with the Lassa fever virus. The symptoms of the disease usually start with a fever and general body weakness. Other symptoms include: High fever (38.5oC or above), sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, restlessness, swelling of the face, bleeding through body openings (nose, ears, eyes, mouth, etc.) IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEAREST HEALTH CENTRE/HOSPITAL. THE ACTIONS EXPECTED FROM A HEALTHCARE WORKER WOULD BE TO TEST FOR MALARIA AND OTHER COMMON CAUSES OF FEVER. IF THESE TESTS ARE NEGATIVE, LASSA FEVER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. Prevention •Avoid all contact with rats (dead or alive). •Keep the house and surrounding clean always. Dirt attracts rats. •Block all holes around the house. •Clear all bushes around the house to avoid breeding sites for rats. •Put refuse into covered dustbins and dispose appropriately. •Set traps for rats around the house to eliminate rats. •Carry out periodic fumigation of the surrounding. •Store food items in rat-proof and covered containers. •Cover all cooked food and water to prevent contamination by urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats. •Wash fruits and vegetables with clean water before eating. •Avoid spreading food items along roadsides and open spaces to avoid rat infestation. •When caring for loved ones who are suspected or confirmed to have Lassa fever, use gloves and protected gowns. •Patients who die from Lassa Fever must have safe burial. This is important to prevent further transmission in the community. Treatment Lassa fever can be treated. Early presentation to a healthcare facility increases the chances of survival.

Three states in Nigeria; Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi State carry 85% of the burden of Lassa fever cases currently. Given the unprecedented outbreak, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has raised the activation of its Emergency Operations Centre to its highest possible level. With this escalation, all the resources available to the agency will be focused primarily on controlling this outbreak. The World Health Organisation and other partners are also mobilising resources to support activities of the Centre and the States most affected. The Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole in the recently held Emergency Council of Health meeting in Abuja called on all States in Nigeria to escalate their response activities. Given the present circumstances, he requested that each State urgently invest resources in protecting the health of residents of their States by carrying out risk communication activities to inform residents on simple measures to prevent infection, and what to do when they become ill. Healthcare workers across the country have also been re-educated on Lassa fever, especially in recognising early symptoms to ensure rapid referral for appropriate care and on the use of universal precautions to protect themselves and their patients. With the activation of the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja, the testing capacity in Nigeria has increased from two to three laboratories. This is in addition to the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, which were the only two laboratories with the capacity to diagnose Lassa fever. Efforts are currently being made to ensure that there is a functional molecular laboratory with the capacity to test for Lassa fever in each of the six geopolitical zones in the country. Despite the challenges, the Federal Government through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, and its partners have ensured that every patient diagnosed with Lassa fever has gotten appropriate treatment. Also, healthcare workers in the major treatment centres at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Federal Medical Centre Owo and the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki have received adequate supplies of personal protective equipment to manage their patients from Government and partners. NCDC calls on all Nigerians, especially those living in Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi States to continue focusing on prevention by ensuring they prevent access to their foodstuff by rodents. For those that fall ill with fever, it is important to go to a healthcare facility in order to get a test that will determine the cause of the fever, before treating. NCDC, with the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Health, remains committed to working with sister agencies and partners to ensure that this outbreak is brought under control and Nigeria is better prepared to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks.

While we acknowledge the high cost of treating Lassa fever cases in Nigeria, especially the cost of the drug Ribavirin, we want to state unequivocally that the Federal Government of Nigeria has ensured that Ribavirin has been provided free-of-charge to patients, for every single case of Lassa fever reported in Nigeria in 2018. Despite the significant costs, there has not been a single day of stock-out of Ribavirin in any of the treatment centres in Nigeria. No single patient has been deprived of care in in any of the treatment centres in Nigeria because of their ability to pay. In addition to this, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has ensured that every state in Nigeria has an emergency stock of Ribavirin and other response commodities available to manage cases. In addition to Ribavirin, the treatment centres have been provided with other essential commodities required for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lassa fever cases. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has had rapid response teams, supporting the state governments of Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi for six weeks supporting all aspects of the response. The state governments of the Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi States, with the highest burden of Lassa fever have also contributed significantly to the management of cases, ensuring that every single patient has received the best treatment possible. All three state governments have supported treatment centres with dialysis machines and other equipment necessary for the treatment of Lassa fever patients. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has regularly kept Nigerians updated on its efforts to control the Lassa fever outbreak through regular situation reports available on its website (http://www.ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps), as well as regular press interviews including the Nigerian Guardian Newspaper. Unfortunately, the newspaper house did not contact NCDC to confirm this statement before going to press. The Honourable Minister of Health in response to the article said: “While the Nigerian Government has welcomed the support of Non-Governmental Organisations such as the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), they have come to support existing efforts by the Federal Government and State Governments who continue to lead the response to the Lassa fever outbreak”. The Federal Government of Nigeria accepts primary responsibility for the response, a responsibility that we take very seriously.” The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) assures Nigerians that everything possible is being done not only to respond to this outbreak, but to also build our capacity to prevent, detect and respond to future cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria. We urge Nigerians to continue supporting the diligent work being done by Nigerian healthcare workers across the country in this response.

The response is now gathering steam with an escalation of efforts to control spread in all the foci of infections across the country. A critical aspect of outbreak control is research, to rapidly understand the drivers of infection and opportunities for control. A relatively new tool available to epidemiologists and researchers is the use of whole genome sequencing during outbreaks. Real-time sequencing of viruses can reveal crucial details that contribute to the understanding and the control of infectious disease outbreaks. It is now possible to resolve chains of transmission to a level of detail otherwise unachievable using traditional methods. Researchers at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, in collaboration with partners from the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Germany, and others (see below) have deployed real-time sequencing of Lassa fever viruses from the on-going outbreak to learn key lessons to influence control efforts. The real-time availability of sequencing information for the current 2018 Lassa fever viruses will support the response to the on-going Lassa fever outbreak. On the 10th March 2018, the analysis of a first set of seven Lassa virus draft sequences derived from the blood of seven laboratory-confirmed Lassa fever patients from Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, and Imo States was completed. In addition, 83 unpublished sequences obtained during previous years from various parts of Nigeria were made available for comparison with the sequences of the 2018 outbreak. From the analysis, of these results, we can draw the following preliminary conclusions: •No new virus lineages have so far been detected, meaning that the circulating viruses appear to be very similar to the viruses from previous years; •Lassa fever cases appear to be mostly caused by viruses that are not epidemiologically linked; •The viruses circulating in 2018 appear to originate from the pool of lineages and strains known to be circulating in Nigeria and are consistent with previous outbreaks; •The most likely route of transmission continues to be spill over of viruses from the rodent reservoir to humans rather than extensive human-to-human transmission. The most important question being investigated at the moment is what has caused an outbreak of this magnitude, at this time? One of the possible answers to this question is the emergence of a new Lassa virus lineage or strain with increased virulence or transmissibility. Evidence from this work, although limited to seven viruses at the moment suggests that this is unlikely to be the case. Over the last year, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has improved its disease surveillance, detection and response system. This includes the operationalisation of the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja, to add to existing diagnostic capacity, with its capacity to test for Lassa fever in ISTH and Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). According to Chief Executive Office, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, “As the system continues to be strengthened, there is likely to be an increase in the number of cases detected and reported.

Rapid response teams will remain in the most affected states, while specific response activities including the strengthening of infection prevention practice as well as social mobilisation activities are being intensified.  In the last reporting week, ending on the 25th March 2018, 18 new confirmed cases of Lassa fever were reported. So far, a total of 394 confirmed cases and 95 deaths have been recorded between January 1st and March 25th. Over the past five weeks, we have had a generally downward trend in new cases. However, surveillance data from previous outbreaks indicate that the typical peak transmission season for Lassa fever has not passed, so it is important to continue to strengthen surveillance and response activities.  NCDC, WHO and all other partners involved in the outbreak continue to intensify response operations especially the continued engagement with affected communities to prevent, recognise and report cases of Lassa fever.  NCDC and WHO calls on all Nigerians, especially those living in Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi States to continue focusing on prevention. Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good community hygiene to discourage rodents from entering homes. Other effective measures include storing grains and other foodstuff in rodent-proof containers, proper disposal of garbage far from the home, and maintaining clean households. All foods must be cooked thoroughly, and family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons.  Lassa fever is a viral infection caused by the Lassa fever virus, primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact, eating food or drinking water contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. Person-to-person transmission is through contact with blood, urine, saliva, throat secretion or semen of an infected person. The disease can be treated, with early presentation to a healthcare facility greatly increasing the chances of survival. Early signs of the disease include sudden fever, sore throat and general body weakness.  Health care workers are urged to maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever when handling patients, irrespective of their health status. Lassa fever should be considered in patients with fever, headache and malaise, in whom malaria has been ruled out with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), especially when patients are not getting better. Health workers should adhere to standard precautions including wearing protective apparels when handling suspected Lassa fever patients.  The CEO of NCDC has said that “NCDC and its partners will continue to support the States with the expertise, commodities and human resources that they need to respond appropriately”.  The Country Representative of WHO also stated that “WHO remains committed to support the excellent work being done by the country, we will stand by the country, not only until the end of this outbreak, but to ensure that we learn the lessons needed to prevent a large outbreak happening in the future”.  The WHO is also monitoring and supporting the neighbouring countries of Nigeria in improving their level of preparedness and readiness to respond more effectively to any potential outbreaks that might occur.  NCDC and WHO continues to strengthen efforts to bring this outbreak under control and to ensure that the country is better prepared for future outbreaks.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/140/public-health-advisory-on-listeriosis", "title": "Public Health Advisory on Listeriosis", "body": "On the 17th of March 2018, the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration Control (NAFDAC) issued an alert on the outbreak of Listeriosis in South Africa, associated with ready to eat meat products imported to Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has therefore issued this public health advisory note to members of the public. Listeriosis is a food-borne disease transmitted by the bacterium, Listeria monoctytogenes. The transmission of the disease is usually by consumption of contaminated foods especially unpaesturised milk, ready to eat meat products such as sausages and cheese, vegetables. Transmission is also possible from mother to fetus or from mother to child during birth. The symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, and may also lead to nausea or diarrhea. If infection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. Listerosis can be prevented. To do this, ensure safe and proper handling of food. Ensure that raw meat or fish is stored separately from other food items, wash your hands before and after handling food, rinse fresh fruits and vegetables before consumption, disinfect knives and other kitchen equipment used in preparing raw meat, chicken or fish. It is important to ensure that food is stored safely- cold or hot as is appropriate. As the listeria bacteria can grow in refrigerator or freezer, ensure immediate cleanup of spills such as blood from raw meat or poultry. The labels placed on food packaging provides information about when to use the food and how to store it. It is important to pay attention to this before consuming food. Newborn infants, pregnant women and the elderly are susceptible to infection from Listera bacteria. Listerosis can be treated effectively, if treatment is initiated early. It is important to visit a health facility if you experience any of the symptoms listed above. Health workers are advised to ensure Retail stores in Nigeria are advised to adhere to the ban on importation of food products associated with the outbreak in South Africa.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/143/public-health-advisory-on-ebola", "title": "Public Health Advisory on Ebola", "body": "On the 8th of May 2018, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Bikoro, Congo. Between the 4th of April and 5th of May 2018, 19 suspected Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (VHF) cases and 16 deaths had been reported, according to a report by the World Health Organisation. Of the five samples tested, two were positive to Ebola virus disease (EVD). The World Health Organisation has classified Nigeria and other countries in the African region to be at moderate risk of spread. To prevent an outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control presents this public health advisory to the general public. Ebola Virus Disease is a rare disease that can lead to death mostly affecting human and non-human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). It is caused by an infection with one of five known Ebola virus species, four of which can cause disease in human. The virus can be transmitted via direct contact with bodily fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from EVD. The virus can get in through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also be spread through contact with objects contaminated by infected persons as well as direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected fruit bats or primates. When infected, a person with Ebola may present with symptoms such as sudden high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. A distinct symptom of Ebola and other VHFs is unexplained bleeding from body openings. The symptoms may appear 2 to 21 days after exposure to an infection. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is currently coordinating a national working group that is assessing and managing the risk to Nigeria. We are in close communication with our partners including the World Health Organisation, who are in Congo to monitor and respond to the situation. The Port Health services unit has been placed on alert and have heightened screening measures at ports of entries. Letters of alert have also been sent to all States to enhance surveillance activities. To prevent the spread of Ebola, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following precautions: •Wash your hands frequently using soap and water – use hand sanitizers when soap and water is not readily available •Avoid direct handling of dead wild animals •Avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection with an unknown diagnosis •Make sure fruit and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them Health care workers are advised to ensure universal care precautions at all times. This includes the use of personal protective equipment when handling patients always. In addition, patients who are suspected to have Ebola should be immediately isolated from other patients. NCDC remains fully committed and capable of protecting the health of all Nigerians from infectious disease outbreaks.

During this outbreak we saw more confirmed cases than the country had ever recorded. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and partners led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), led response activities across the country. This included strengthening of infrastructure at the three main treatment centres in Irrua, Owo and Abakaliki; inclusion of a fourth laboratory for Lassa fever diagnosis at the Virology Centre, Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki; deployment of Rapid Response Teams to affected States; provision of drugs and personal protective equipment for treatment as well as risk communications activities to increase awareness across the country. During the outbreak, nearly 85% of confirmed cases were from Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi. During the 2018 outbreak, more than ever before, the Institute of Lassa Fever Research and Control at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) played a major role. This Institute manages the largest burden of Lassa fever cases in Nigeria and globally. Over the years, we have grown in our capacity to manage and diagnose Lassa fever cases. Our health workers have been trained and effectively manage cases of Lassa fever cases till they are discharged. While ISTH certainly cannot claim to have found all solutions to all the challenges, we have developed unique strengths in the management of Lassa fever. It is in line with this that we have set up collaboration with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), to implement a nationwide training of health workers on Lassa fever clinical diagnosis and management. We know that given the epidemiology of Lassa fever in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. Our goal is to support other healthcare facilities in strengthening their capacity to manage Lassa fever cases. This training will include Lassa Fever case management physicians and nurses at treatment centres, State Epidemiologists, State Disease Surveillance Officers, State Laboratory Scientists, and State Health Educators. These officers will be held accountable for the response and management of subsequent Lassa Fever outbreaks in their States. The first phase which happened in the South West hosted by Ondo State, was deeply encouraging as health workers came with heightened zeal and dedication to take over the responsibility of managing Lassa fever cases in their States. By the end of the training across the country, we hope to have built the capacity of frontline clinical, laboratory and public health workers on case management, laboratory diagnosis, prevention and control of Lassa Fever. In addition to this, we are working to improve the knowledge and skills of surveillance officers and healthcare workers for effective Lassa fever outbreak response. From the 22nd of May, we will be in South-East Nigeria and subsequently complete all zones in the country by mid-2018. The collaboration between ISTH and NCDC is an exemplary one, relying on each other’s strengths to build a stronger workforce for Lassa fever management in Nigeria. We remain grateful to the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Health and all health workers who selflessly carry out their duties in protecting the health of Nigerians.

There have been confirmed outbreaks of Cholera in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Kano, Plateau, Yobe, Nasarawa, Anambra and Zamfara States. The ongoing strike action by some health workers in the country is affecting the provision of care in health facilities in many States. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is issuing this public health advisory note to members of the public to be aware of the risk and take appropriate precautions. Cholera is a disease that causes acute watery diarrhoea in children and adults and if left untreated can lead to death within hours. While cholera is endemic in Nigeria, there is an increase in the number of cases during the rainy season, usually between April and September. The primary reason for this is the contamination of drinking water supplies by excreta from infected people. The solution to preventing cholera is in providing potable drinking water. Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholera, which is found in the stool of an infected person and spreads to other people when they consume contaminated food or water. Cholera transmission is more common in areas with overcrowding, poor sanitation and hygiene practices, lack of clean food and water, and areas where open defecation is common practice. Cholera is characterised by sudden onset of severe acute watery diarrhea, which can lead to death as a result of dehydration, if not managed on time. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Most people who have been infected may not show symptoms or have mild symptoms. Cholera is an easily treatable disease, if detected early. Most infected people people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS) and supportive treatment. To reduce the spread of Cholera, the NCDC advises that precautionary measures should be taken, and offers the following five priority actions to Nigerians: 1.Ensure water is well boiled before drinking and bottled water is properly sealed. Store boiled water in a clean and safe container 2.Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available 3.Ensure all food is well cooked before consumption. Avoid raw foods such as fruits and vegetables, except you have washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself. 4.Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping and ensure proper disposal of waste and clearing of sewage 5.If you experience sudden watery diarrhoea, please visit a health care facility immediately and take all sick persons with the signs or symptoms above to a health care facility immediately The NCDC has deployed Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) to some of the affected States. NCDC and its partners, especially the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and Medecin Sans Frontiers (MSF) will continue to support the response to cholera. We advise that there should be an increased focus on the provision of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH). States are encouraged to ensure early reporting, adequate preparedness including provision of WaSH facilities, medical supplies, and institution of proper case management practices.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/146/the-response-to-cholera-outbreaks-continue", "title": "THE RESPONSE TO CHOLERA OUTBREAKS CONTINUE", "body": "Over the last few months, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been supporting many States in the country to respond to outbreaks of cholera. The primary focus of the response has been to improve access to water and sanitation in these States. In addition, vaccination campaigns led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) have been carried out in the most affected Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Adamawa and Yobe States. Although cholera cases are still being reported from eight States including Adamawa, Bauchi, Kano, Katsina, Zamfara, Kogi, Plateau and Kaduna, there has been a general decline in the number of new cases. In the last four weeks, no cases have been reported from Anambra, Nasarawa and Yobe States. In response to the outbreak, NCDC with support from its partners activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate the response. Rapid Response Teams were deployed to affected States, where they focused on improving coordination, case management, risk communications and surveillance activities. The Teams also supported the States in strengthening their laboratory capacity to guide interventions, especially oral cholera vaccination campaigns. The water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) component of the response, led by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR), has provided motorised solar-powered boreholes, sanitation units with hand washing facilities, as well as blocks of latrine compartment in affected States. Nigeria is also working with other Lake Chad basin countries to strengthen cross-border collaboration for cholera control. The major challenge leading to outbreaks of cholera is poor water and hygiene facilities in many States. This has contributed to the spread of the disease and yearly outbreaks in many States in Nigeria. States are encouraged to prevent cholera outbreaks by improving access to WaSH. This remains the best way to prevent cholera. The NCDC and partners have begun plans for a national cholera prevention campaign, prioritising States with the highest burden. This campaign will be driving prevention messages through the mass media, new media and community structures to reach households and communities. An oral cholera vaccination strategy is also being developed by our sister agency, NPHCDA. This will not only help to prevent the further spread of this outbreak, but will also help the prevention and preparedness for any future outbreaks. As at the 8th of July 2018, a total of 16,008 suspected cases including 186 deaths had been reported from 16 States since the beginning of the year. According to NCDC Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, “Cholera cases are being treated at designated treatment centres in affected States. We are working with the State Ministries of Health, the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF, Medecin Sans Frontiers (MSF) and other partners to support the response. However, the primary problem and solution lies not in health, but in improving water and sanitation.” The Federal Government of Nigeria and partners will continue to work to reduce the impact of the current outbreak on affected communities and ensure that the outbreak is fully controlled. Planning has already started to prevent future outbreaks and ensure better preparedness. ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases. Its core mandate is to detect, investigate, prevent and control diseases of national and international public health importance.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/141/lowest-number-of-new-lassa-fever-cases-recorded-in-nigeria", "title": "Lowest Number of New Lassa Fever Cases Recorded in Nigeria", "body": "19 April, 2018 | Abuja – LOWEST NUMBER OF NEW LASSA FEVER CASES RECORDED IN NIGERIA As outbreak control efforts have been intensified, only five new confirmed cases of Lassa fever were reported in the week that ended on the 15th of April 2018. This is the lowest number of cases reported in a single week since January 2018. This also marks the eighth week of continuous decline in new confirmed cases showing that the efforts to control the outbreak are bearing fruit. The Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole remarked on the current situation:  “I am happy with the reduction in the number of cases, thanks to the efforts that we have all devoted to this. However, now is not a time to rest on our oars. We will continue to intensify efforts to prevent, detect and respond to Lassa fever and ensure that Nigeria plays a leading role in the global efforts to tackle this disease”. Since the onset of the 2018 outbreak, the Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, State Governments and partners led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) have coordinated response activities. This includes the deployment of Rapid Response Teams to the affected States, deployment of supplies to treatment centres, training of hospital staff on how to prevent the transmission of the virus in hospital settings, community education and other activities. Federal and State Governments have also improved the facilities to manage cases across the country especially at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo, Federal Medical Centre Owo, Ondo and the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi. Despite the reduction in cases, the period of highest risk of Lassa fever has not passed. Therefore, NCDC, States and partners continue to strengthen surveillance activities across the country. This has led to the detection of new sporadic cases in some States, as seen recently in Abia and Adamawa States and a re-enforcement of control measures in those States. In addition to these, critical meetings are being held with stakeholders to review and harmonise national protocols for Lassa fever diagnosis and treatment. A nationwide training by NCDC in collaboration with Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital on the management of patients with Lassa fever is scheduled to begin in May 2018. This aims at improving the skills and competence of a critical mass of health workers in managing cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria. NCDC reiterates that prevention of Lassa fever is everyone’s responsibility. Prevention relies primarily on promoting good community hygiene to discourage rodents from entering homes. Other effective measures include storing grains and other foodstuff in rodent-proof containers, proper disposal of garbage far from the home, and maintaining clean households. All foods must be cooked thoroughly, and family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons. When symptoms similar to Malaria are noticed, visit the nearest health facility and insist on a rapid diagnostic test from the healthcare workers. Healthcare workers are urged to continue maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever when handling patients, irrespective of their health status. Lassa fever should be considered in patients with fever, headache and malaise, in whom malaria has been ruled out with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), especially when patients are not getting better. Health workers should adhere to standard precautions including wearing protective apparels when handling suspected Lassa fever patients.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/147/the-response-to-cholera-outbreaks-continue", "title": "THE RESPONSE TO CHOLERA OUTBREAKS CONTINUE", "body": "19 July, 2018 | Abuja – THE RESPONSE TO CHOLERA OUTBREAKS CONTINUE Over the last few months, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has been supporting many States in the country to respond to outbreaks of cholera. The primary focus of the response has been to improve access to water and sanitation in these States. In addition, vaccination campaigns led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) have been carried out in the most affected Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Adamawa and Yobe States. Although cholera cases are still being reported from eight States including Adamawa, Bauchi, Kano, Katsina, Zamfara, Kogi, Plateau and Kaduna, there has been a general decline in the number of new cases. In the last four weeks, no cases have been reported from Anambra, Nassarawa and Yobe States. In response to the outbreak, NCDC with support from its partners activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate the response. Rapid Response Teams were deployed to affected States, where they focused on improving coordination, case management, risk communications and surveillance activities. The Teams also supported the States in strengthening their laboratory capacity to guide interventions, especially oral cholera vaccination campaigns. The water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) component of the response, led by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR), has provided motorised solar-powered boreholes, sanitation units with hand washing facilities, as well as blocks of latrine compartment in affected States. Nigeria is also working with other Lake Chad basin countries to strengthen cross-border collaboration for cholera control. The major challenge leading to outbreaks of cholera is poor water and hygiene facilities in many States. This has contributed to the spread of the disease and yearly outbreaks in many States in Nigeria. States are encouraged to prevent cholera outbreaks by improving access to WaSH. This remains the best way to prevent cholera. The NCDC and partners have begun plans for a national cholera prevention campaign, prioritising States with the highest burden. This campaign will be driving prevention messages through the mass media, new media and community structures to reach households and communities. An oral cholera vaccination strategy is also being developed by our sister agency, NPHCDA. This will not only help to prevent the further spread of this outbreak, but will also help the prevention and preparedness for any future outbreaks. As at the 8th of July 2018, a total of 16,008 suspected cases including 186 deaths had been reported from 16 States since the beginning of the year. According to NCDC Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, “Cholera cases are being treated at designated treatment centres in affected States. We are working with the State Ministries of Health, the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF, Medecin Sans Frontiers (MSF) and other partners to support the response. However, the primary problem and solution lies not in health, but in improving water and sanitation.” The Federal Government of Nigeria and partners will continue to work to reduce the impact of the current outbreak on affected communities and ensure that the outbreak is fully controlled. Planning has already started to prevent future outbreaks and ensure better preparedness. ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases. Its core mandate is to detect, investigate, prevent and control diseases of national and international public health importance.

Following a joint epidemiological review by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation, the country is pleased to announce the end of the emergency phase of the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak. Since the beginning of the outbreak in January 2018, 423 confirmed cases including 106 deaths have been recorded. The Lassa fever case count has consistently declined in the past six weeks and has now dropped below levels considered to be a national emergency. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and partners led by the World Health Organisation (WHO), have led response activities across the country. This includes strengthening of infrastructure at the three main treatment centres in Irrua, Owo and Abakaliki; inclusion of a fourth laboratory for Lassa fever diagnosis at the Virology Centre, Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki; deployment of Rapid Response Teams to affected States; provision of drugs and personal protective equipment for treatment as well as risk communications activities to increase awareness across the country. Given the epidemiology of Lassa fever in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. Several medium and long-term activities have been put in place to enhance preparedness and response. In collaboration with the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, NCDC has begun a nationwide training of health care workers on Lassa fever case management and diagnosis. The South West phase of this training has been concluded, while the training continues in the South East from the 14th of May 2018. In addition, NCDC is working with WHO to strengthen research activities on Lassa fever including new diagnostic approaches and improved treatment options. Despite the end of the emergency phase of this outbreak, NCDC and its partners will continue to maintain intensive preparedness and response activities for Lassa fever. This includes supporting States with the expertise, commodities and human resources needed to respond to cases appropriately. The focus is to enhance disease prevention, surveillance, diagnostic and response infrastructure across all levels in Nigeria.  According to Honourable Minister of Health for Nigeria, Professor Isaac Adewole “The response to this outbreak has been an example of how outbreak response should work, collaboration between Federal and State Governments, between Nigeria and international partners, between public health and clinical services. However, we know that now is not the time to celebrate, but to reinvigorate our efforts to learn more on how to prevent, detect and control Lassa fever in Nigeria”. According to Dr Ibrahima Socé Fall, WHO Regional Emergencies Director for Africa “Nigeria is to be congratulated for reaching this important milestone in the fight against Lassa fever. But we cannot let our foot off the pedal. We must ensure we learn the lessons needed to better manage large outbreaks in the future in all countries at risk in our region”.  The Government of Nigeria remains very grateful to all its partners including WHO, UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control, Alliance for Medical Action (ALIMA), Robert Koch Institute and Bernard Nocht Institute in Germany, UK Public Health Rapid Support Team, Medecins Sans Frontiers, and other organisations. We also thank all health workers for their hard work and dedication during this outbreak.

Most of the States are around the Rivers Niger and Benue. Flooding is an event of public health interest due to the resultant outcomes of mortality, morbidity, displacement, loss of property and livelihood. In addition, there is an increased risk of contamination of water supply. Contact with contaminated water increases the risk of transmission of infectious diseases and can lead to outbreaks. Flood sites also provide a breeding ground for disease vectors. To reduce the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever; and vector-borne diseases such as malaria and yellow fever during flooding, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises that precautionary measures should be taken. We offer ten key messages to Nigerians: 1.Do not drink flood water, or use it to wash dishes, brush teeth, or wash/prepare food 2.Communities should ensure chlorination of the public source of water supply 3.Ensure proper disposal of waste and clearing of sewage 4.Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water 5.Discard all medicines, food and bottled water contaminated by flood water 6.In homes, ensure water is well boiled before drinking 7.Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping 8.Avoid mosquito bites by ensuring consistent use of an Insecticide Treated Net 9.Health workers should observe universal care precautions at all time 10.If you experience sudden fever or diarrhea, please visit a health care facility IMMEDIATELY ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases.

The aim is to develop a formal structure for the private sector to support the Nigerian government through NCDC, in the prevention, preparedness, detection, response and control of outbreaks in Nigeria. The A4EPR is designed to address priority areas in health security, focusing on building the capacity to protect the health of Nigerians. These priority areas include – purchase of equipment for outbreak preparedness and response; support to States during outbreaks; advocacy and communications as well as capacity development. The launch of A4EPR by the Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole took place at a Private Sector Roundtable on Health Security in Lagos State. The event had the Honourable Minister of State for Health, Lagos State Commissioner for Health and over fifty representatives from private sector organisations in Nigeria. The roundtable was also an opportunity for government officials and the private sector to discuss public-private partnerships in building resilient health systems to advance the country’s emergency preparedness and response to disease threats. The recent outbreaks of Lassa fever, Monkeypox, yellow fever, cholera and meningitis have caused significant strain to the nation’s public health sector. In addition to this, these outbreaks affect the country’s economy through loss of labour, reduced productivity and inefficiency of businesses. The Honourable Minister of Health Professor Isaac Adewole while launching the A4EPR emphasised that the Federal Ministry of Health is very proud of the initiative and expressed commitment to support the alliance. He cited three key lessons from the 2014 Ebola outbreak response in Nigeria including strong partnership between State and Federal Governments, public-private partnerships and effective team work. The event also had a panel discussion with representatives from Dangote Foundation, Total E&P, MTN Foundation, Tony Elumelu Foundation, Facebook and the Lagos State Commissioner for Health. Each panellist shared their organisation’s experience as part of the 2014 Ebola outbreak response and other outbreak response activities, highlighting recommendations and areas for future collaboration. In describing the efforts to develop an initiative as A4EPR, the CEO of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu and his counterpart at PHN, Dr. Muntaqa Umar-Sadiq expressed their optimism that will serve as a secure and sustainable platform for public-private partnerships in Nigeria’s health sector. In the next year, A4EPR will work towards securing commitments from the private sector to achieve its objectives.

This includes Nigeria where outbreaks of Lassa fever, Cerebrospinal Meningitis, MonkeyPox, Cholera, etc have been reported in the last two years. The risk of future outbreaks and possible emergence of an unknown disease highlights the urgency and need to build more resilient health systems and national public health institutes. At the 3rd Annual Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (NFELTP) scientific conference which held recently in Abuja, over 200 epidemiologists and public health practitioners convened to share their scientific work. This gathering also deliberated on the application of epidemiological methods to address public health issues in Nigeria and globally. Currently in its 10th year, the NFELTP program comprises of a network of highly skilled field epidemiologists who play a key role in safeguarding national and global health security. The NFELTP residents have supported NCDC in responding to over 300 public health emergencies including viral haemorrhagic fevers like Ebola, Lassa Fever, Cholera, Cerebrospinal Meningitis, Measles events among other diseases in Nigeria. Delivering the keynote address at the conference themed: “Strengthening Health Security through Field Epidemiology”, the Honourable Minister of State for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, underscored the importance of the NFELTP program while calling on stakeholders to work together, as achieving national and global health security requires a multi-sectoral approach. “One thing that has stood out for us in Nigeria and for our sister countries in Africa, is the rise of field epidemiologists as foot soldiers during outbreaks. We saw it in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone during the outbreak of Ebola where in fact many residents and graduates of the Nigeria FELTP were part of the mission. We have seen this in every outbreak Nigeria has had to respond to over the last few years. The NFELTP program is a great source of pride to the Ministry of Health and Government of Nigeria.” Ehanire said. In his welcome address, the Chief Executive of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu reiterated the importance of stakeholders working together in Nigeria and the need to strengthen public health institutes on the continent to achieve their mandate. “Increasingly, with the complex public health landscape, ensuring national health security is no longer limited to the government alone. Individuals, businesses, communities, academia, and all levels of government, have important roles to play in protecting the health of Nigerians.” Ihekweazu said. In the past year, the NCDC and NFELTP program have made great progress in preventing, preparing for, detecting and responding to disease outbreaks. At the conference, attendees agreed that a gap still exists in the scientific evidence required to detect new emerging diseases, with the need to strengthen this area. The conference attracted stakeholders from the public sector, academia and international public health community; which includes Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), WHO, UNICEF, National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Ahmadu Bello University, University of Ibadan and Public Health England (PHE). Dr. Chima Ohuabunwo, Executive Director, Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), encouraged the conference attendees to leverage on the discussions from the NFELTP conference to work with relevant stakeholders to influence health policy and strengthen health security in Nigeria.

Since the re-emergence of Monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017, NCDC has continued to receive reports and respond to cases of the disease from states across the country. Between September 2017 when the outbreak started and 31st of August 2018, a total of 262 suspected cases had been reported from 26 states. Of these, 113 have been confirmed in 16 states with seven deaths. The highest number of cases have been reported from states in the South-South region of Nigeria. Following the recent report of the two cases in the UK, NCDC has been working with the UK’s public health agency; Public Health England (PHE), the public health departments in the affected states and other partners in Nigeria to investigate these cases. The NCDC has also been working closely with states across the country to strengthen surveillance, detection and response to cases of Monkeypox. A Technical Working Group coordinated by NCDC and comprising of partners from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control (US CDC) and other agencies, meet weekly to ensure coordination. In addition, NCDC met with stakeholders recently, including surveillance officers and case management physicians from all affected states to review the actions taken so far and strategise on how to strengthen the country’s response. Monkeypox is a virus that is spread primarily from animals to humans, with symptoms such as fever, headache, body pain, malaise, lymphadenopathy (enlargement of glands), sore throat and the typical generalized vesicular rash. This may last for two to four weeks. Transmission is via direct contact with infected animals, human, or contaminated materials. The virus does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. Monkeypox is generally self-limiting, which means patients tend to recover in a couple of weeks. However, supportive care and management of the condition is required and mostly successful. Control measures include isolation of suspected or confirmed cases, strict adherence to universal precautions, especially frequent handwashing with soap and water and the use of personal protective equipment. We re-assure Nigerians that NCDC has the capacity to effectively diagnose and respond to cases of Monkeypox. The National Reference Laboratory in Abuja has the capacity to test for cases of Monkeypox with a quick turn-around time. We therefore encourage any healthcare worker that suspects a case of Monkeypox, to reach out to their State Epidemiology team for appropriate action. Guidelines on the management of Monkeypox cases and outbreaks can be found on the NCDC’s website https://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines.

This process has been coordinated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. From the 23rd to 27th of July 2018, NCDC hosted a final five-day workshop in Abuja to complete the development of the National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS). The National Action Plan identifies priority areas for action, will enable effective resource mobilisation and ensure country ownership for health security planning. Following the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of IHR (2005) capacities in Nigeria in 2017, the development of a prioritised national plan for health security was recommended. This is to address the identified gaps and implement key recommendations that will strengthen capacities to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. With the strong political commitment from the government and support from partners including the WHO, US Centers for Disease Control (US CDC) and RESOLVE, several of the gaps identified in the JEE have been addressed, and a plan developed. In his opening remarks, the NCDC Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, emphasised the Federal Government’s commitment to improving outbreak preparedness and response in Nigeria. “Notably, over a year after this process, several gaps identified from the evaluation have already been addressed; given the strong political commitment to strengthening health security in Nigeria. For the first time we are bringing key stakeholders from different agencies and sectors including agriculture, uniformed services and others to develop a plan on how Nigeria can better protect its populace against outbreaks of infectious diseases”. This is the first time Nigeria will have a multi-sectoral action plan that defines roles and timelines of stakeholders across the country in ensuring health security. Prior to this validation and costing workshop, stakeholders had met in February to define roles and responsibilities and develop a draft of the national action plan. Mrs. Olubunmi Ojo, Director of Surveillance NCDC who has led the project, also expressed her optimism on the completion of the national action plan. She reminded the stakeholders present of the significant work to be done to achieve the country’s goals and urged all involved to work towards implementation of the NAPHS. Dr. Ifeanyi Okudo of WHO expressed the organisation’s readiness and commitment to work with the Nigerian government to protect the health of its citizens. Participants in the workshop included representatives and relevant stakeholders from various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), health parastatals, health-based civil society organizations experts in the legal, security, immunisation, and risk communications sectors. For the first time in history, Nigeria has a multi-sectoral action plan that defines the roles of stakeholders across the country in ensuring health security.

Recent epidemiological data shows that this trend usually occurs during the dry season, between January and April. As at 13 January 2019, a total of 60 confirmed cases have been reported in eight states. See latest situation report here (https://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/sitreps) Given this increase in reported cases of Lassa fever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has declared this an outbreak and activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate the response. The national EOC includes representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, US Centers for Disease Control, as well as other partners. In preparation for this year’s emergency phase, NCDC has been providing support to states including the provision of emergency supplies and deployment of Rapid Response Teams (RRT). The RRTs will work with states in response coordination, contact tracing, case management, risk communication and strengthening infection prevention and control practices. Since the Lassa fever outbreak in 2018, NCDC has worked with states to ensure better preparedness and improved response. In the last one year, guidelines have been revised, new data management tools have been developed and the laboratory network has been strengthened. Additionally, risk communications has been strengthened through radio, posters, flyers and social media. A national research plan has been developed, to enable its full integration into the outbreak response to gain a better understanding of the disease. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Health care workers in health facilities are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, especially where infection prevention and control procedures are not strictly adhered to. NCDC advises members of the public to focus on prevention by practicing good personal hygiene and proper environmental sanitation. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households, and other measures to discourage rodents from entering homes. Hand washing should be practiced frequently. The public is also advised to avoid bush burning. Health care workers are again reminded that Lassa fever presents initially like any other disease causing febrile illness such as malaria; and are advised to practice standard precautions at all times, and to maintain a high index of suspicion. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) must be applied to all suspected cases of malaria. When the RDT is negative, other causes of febrile illness including Lassa fever should be considered. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment increases the chances of survival. The national guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control, as well as Lassa fever case management have been developed, disseminated to States and are available on the NCDC website for download (http://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines). The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control remains committed to supporting all States’ public health teams to prevent and respond to public health threats.

Following the report of an outbreak of fever of unknown origin in four Local Government Areas in Edo state, the state public health team commenced investigation. On the 21st of November 2018, nine cases tested positive for yellow fever. We await confirmatory results from the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory. The Edo State Epidemiology Team is working with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and World Health Organisation (WHO) to carry out a detailed investigation and response to the already confirmed cases. The NCDC has deployed a rapid response team to support the State with active case search, risk communications and management of cases. There are ongoing plans to begin a reactive vaccination campaign in the affected Local Government area in response to the cluster of cases. Yellow fever virus is spread through bites by an infected mosquito. It is a completely vaccine preventable disease and a single shot provides immunity for a lifetime. The yellow fever vaccine is freely available to all children under one year as part of the routine immunisation schedule in primary health care centres in Nigeria. In addition to the vaccine, the public are advised to keep their environments clean and free of stagnant water to discourage the breeding of mosquitoes and use insecticide treated mosquito nets, screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquito bites. Since September 2017, Nigeria has recorded suspected cases of yellow fever in all states in the country. As at the 11th of November, 140 cases have been laboratory confirmed in Nigeria. A multi-agency yellow fever Emergency Operations Centre has been established at NCDC to coordinate the response. The symptoms of yellow fever include yellowness of the eyes, sudden fever, headache and body pain. If you have these symptoms or notice someone in your community displaying them, please contact your nearest health centre. This week, our sister agency NPHCDA flagged off a large yellow fever vaccination campaign, targeting 26 million children and adults (aged 9 months to 44 years) in six states: Niger, Plateau, Borno, Sokoto, Kebbi and the FCT. One dose of the yellow fever vaccine provides for life-long protection against the disease. We urge all Nigerians to get vaccinated and encourage their families, and neighbours to do the same. The NCDC reassures all Nigerians that we will continue to work with States and partners nationwide to ensure that the outbreak is curtailed.

This is the first global pandemic response training exercise, and the third in a series of simulations this year, following regional exercises in Jordan and Senegal. Our national EOC located at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Abuja has joined the exercise. Participants are drawn from the Incident Coordination Centre (ICC) at NCDC, the ‘one health’ Ministries (Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Environment, and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development), the World Health Organisation (WHO) country office in Nigeria and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) Country Office. A representative from the Public Health England is part of the exercise as the evaluator for Nigeria. Other national EOCs will take part in the interactive scenario, responding to emailed inputs from the WHO EOC. The scenario will revolve around an outbreak of influenza with pandemic potential on the fictional island nation of Mizzou, located off the coast of North America. There is no actual virus: this is an internet training exercise. The training exercise takes place only within the offices of national and international EOCs. There is no deployment of people or goods. The exercise will not affect public or official activity. The exercise is occurring on the centenary of the 1918 influenza pandemic (“Spanish flu”), which is estimated to have infected one third of the global population and resulted in the deaths of millions of people. The most recent global flu pandemic occurred about a decade ago. These events occur periodically and it is only a matter of a time before another global pandemic occurs. Member States have been working diligently with WHO to be prepared for the next event. The exercise offers participants a way to test their plans and capabilities in a realistic environment to gain an in-depth experience that can best be achieved by practice. Evaluators drawn from Asia, North America, Europe, and Africa will be watching how the participating EOCs perform in real time, measuring performance against what is expected from existing procedures. This experience will identify gaps and areas for opportunity that will ultimately help in the assessment and improvement of Member States’ readiness to respond jointly and effectively to a global public health emergency. The exercise is only a part of the many ways WHO supports countries to be ready for global health emergencies. The invitation to Nigeria to participate in this global exercise through the NCDC is a recognition of the critical role of NCDC in global health security.

Over the last few years, the country has experienced outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Lassa fever, cerebrospinal meningitis, Ebola, as well as a resurgence of yellow fever and monkeypox. The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been described as the second largest outbreak of the particular strain, highlighting the need for regional and global preparedness. In a move to bolster Nigeria’s health security capacities and ensure that the country is better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies, 19 federal agencies have come together to develop and launch the National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS) in Abuja, today. This process has been coordinated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control as the country’s International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) national focal point, with support from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other partners. The NAPHS follows an intensive Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of the country's IHR capacities, carried out in 2017. The NAPHS outlines activities that will enhance coordination across Nigeria’s MDAs with a role to play in health security, and build capacities across 19 technical areas. Speaking at the launch, the Honourable Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole, noted that this strategic plan would enable proper planning, prioritisation and resource mobilisation, to strengthen health security and public health emergencies capacity in Nigeria. “This plan is a significant investment aimed at enhancing our preparedness and response strategy. Outbreaks in the last few years have reinforced the need to institute safeguards that will ensure that as a nation, we are better prepared at all times to deal swiftly and decisively with issues pertaining to health security.” Adewole said. Furthermore, he stated that the launch of the National Action Plan is not the end of the process. \"The success of NAPHS will depend on the implementation of the priority actions. We often emphasise that health security involves not only the health sector, but all sectors working towards national security. It gives me great joy that for the first time in this country and under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, we have brought together all players involved in protecting the health of Nigerians - within and outside the health sector.\" In his remarks, the NCDC Director General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu lauded the government’s unwavering commitment to improving emergency preparedness and response in Nigeria, describing the launch of the NAPHS as a show of increased commitment to national health security. “I am happy that together with other agencies and stakeholders, we have developed a holistic and clear plan for national health security. Through this process, we have been able to bring together the various stakeholders with a role to play in protecting the health of Nigerians - from security agencies to nuclear regulatory bodies and several others. The NCDC in its role as the IHR national focal point will continue to work with all our partners, so that Nigeria is better prepared to manage public health risks”, Ihekweazu said. The World Health Organization (WHO) Director General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in his remarks delivered by the acting WHO Country Representative in Nigeria, emphasised that WHO remains committed to supporting the implementation of Nigeria’s NAPHS. He added “WHO congratulates Nigeria for the steps you have taken to establish the NCDC and to launch a National Action Plan for Health Security. This is an encouraging progress. Ultimately, the best defense against outbreaks and other crisis is strong, resilient health systems based on people-centred primary care.” Dr. Tedros said. The launch also had in attendance representatives of the Honourable Ministers of Agriculture and Rural Development, Science and Technology, Environment as well as leaders of the various agencies involved, UN agency representatives, members of the diplomatic community, civil society organisations and technical committee members.

Over the last one month, there has been an increase in the reporting of suspected cases of CSM in Katsina, Zamfara, Jigawa, Yobe, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Sokoto, Kano, Bayelsa and Ondo with confirmed cases of Neisseria Meningitis Type C (Nmc) reported in Zamfara and Jigawa States. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and partners have commenced preparedness activities, through the national CSM Technical Working Group (TWG). The TWG has completed a risk assessment exercise for prioritisation, and issued letters of alert to states to ensure adequate preparedness this season. NCDC is issuing this public health advisory note to members of the public to be aware of the risk and take appropriate precautions. Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM) is an acute inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and the spinal cord. It is a very serious infection that can lead to death if left untreated. CSM remains a major public health challenge, affecting countries in the African meningitis belt, including 25 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Nigeria. Large outbreaks of CSM usually occur during the dry season (i.e. November through May). The disease is contagious and can be transmitted through tiny droplets of respiratory secretions from an infected person, during close contact such as coughing or sneezing. The disease is more common among persons aged less than 15 years and deaths are higher among untreated cases. Signs and symptoms include sudden high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, difficulty concentrating, and convulsions. The major risk factors for infection include overcrowding and poor ventilation. During outbreaks, reactive vaccination campaigns can be used to prevent the spread of the disease. To prevent the spread of CSM, NCDC offers five important tips to members of the public: •Avoid overcrowding and ensure adequate ventilation in the home •Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or by blowing into the elbow when sneezing or coughing. •Wash your hands frequently especially after coughing or sneezing. •Visit a health facility if you have sudden high fever or neck stiffness for diagnosis and treatment •All health workers are advised to practice universal care precautions at all times: i.e. wearing gloves while handling patients or providing care to an ill relative It is very important to report to the nearest health facility immediately, if you experience any of the signs or symptoms listed above. If you notice any member(s) of your family or neighbourhood with any of the listed signs or symptoms, kindly encourage them to report to the nearest health facility. Early presentation to a health facility and treatment increases chances of survival.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/161/innovative-genomics-tool-directs-public-health-response-early-in-outbreak", "title": "Innovative Genomics Tool Directs Public Health Response Early in Outbreak", "body": "•Scientists used a portable sequencing device to rapidly identify virus strains in midst of 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria •Real-time analysis of circulating virus strains enabled public health interventions to be tailored, more quickly and effectively protecting the local population •Technique holds promise for guiding public health response in the event of unknown Pathogen X, that international health organisations predict may be responsible for the next pandemic For the first time during an ongoing Lassa fever outbreak, scientists have used rapid, portable genomic sequencing technology to identify viruses without prior knowledge of the cause of disease. This enabled researchers to allay fears and direct the public health interventions to limit the spread of the virus and help to protect more people from disease. The research, conducted during the 2018 Lassa fever epidemic in Nigeria, was carried out by scientists from Public Health England (UK), the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (Germany) and Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Nigeria), in collaboration with the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), was published in the journal Science on 4 January 2019. Lassa fever is caused by a virus carried in the urine or faeces of infected rats. The virus causes fever, weakness, muscle pain and seizures, and is frequently fatal. Lassa virus occurs endemically in West Africa and while it regularly causes small outbreaks, an outbreak of the virus in the area in early 2018 led to 376 confirmed cases within a few months– more than the combined total for the three previous years. The sudden upsurge in cases raised concerns that a new, highly transmissible form of the virus had evolved, able to pass from person to person more effectively than previous strains. In order to better understand the reasons for the heightened number of cases, the NCDC, together with the WHO, commissioned the research team to analyse patient samples to understand if the virus had an increased transmission potential. The research builds on work that was carried out by PHE and BNITM during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak. The team, working at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) in Irrua, Nigeria, used Oxford Nanopore Technology‘s portable device to rapidly sequence the genetic code of 120 virus samples. Traditionally, genomic assays used in the field required researchers to look at one genetic marker or virus strain at a time. However, this time a different approach was used, in combination with DNA sequencing, and known as metagenomics, which enabled the team to test for multiple different variations of Lassa virus genome, which is known to be highly diverse– speeding up the process of identifying the strains responsible for causing illness in this outbreak. The approach gives insights into the genetic material of an entire virus population at a specific point in time. The researchers found that the strains in the samples weren’t all closely related, suggesting that there wasn’t a single source of the virus that then spread from person to person. Instead, there were lots of different strains, suggesting multiple different instances of contraction from rodents. These early, rapid results allowed teams on the ground to continue focusing the public health response on community engagement around rodent control, environmental sanitation and safe food storage rather than shifting to solely focusing on addressing person to person spread. The analysis revealed a great deal of diversity and indicated mixing with Lassa virus strains of the previous year's outbreaks. \"By using this technology to look at the Lassa virus family tree and comparing samples from this outbreak to those from previous years, we were able to exclude human-to-human transmission as the reason for the surge in cases\" said Prof. Stephan Günther, head of the Virology Department at BNITM, explaining the results. \"Instead, a frequent transmission from animals to humans seems to be the cause of the high case numbers.” Professor Miles Carroll, Head of Research and Development of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, said: “Viruses are constantly changing, becoming more or less infectious and deadly over time. By studying their genetic code, we can better understand where the virus has come from and how it spreads.” \"Our previous tools to probe viral genomes took over a month to provide insights. Now, we can view results in as little as one day and in a field situation, guiding the public health interventions we deliver and ensuring we can act fast to stop more people becoming ill. Human-to-human transmission of viruses is something we always want to avoid, but in this instance the evidence indicated that we also needed to act in other areas for maximum impact.” The Chief Medical Director of ISTH, Prof Sylvanus Okogbenin, said that “the result of the sequencing reassured managing Clinicians in ISTH, the main centre for the diagnosis and treatment of Lassa fever in Nigeria. I’d like to congratulate the team for the feat. The institution is very willing to collaborate further to ensure that on-site sequencing is a regular feature of its institute of Lassa fever research and control”. Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu the Director General of NCDC added that “the results from this study, which were made available to NCDC as they became available, were critical in enabling us provide answers to questions during the outbreak and focus response measures appropriately. We are proud that all the sequencing was done onsite in ISTH, and will work with our partners to increase capacity for metagenomics in Nigeria” The real-time, portable DNA sequencing technology used in this study has applications beyond Lassa fever. By being able to look at lots of different pathogen sequences in one go, the technology could be applied to previously unknown pathogens. This is important because international health agencies have predicted that an unknown ‘Pathogen X’ could cause the next major outbreak. This new technology has the potential to enable scientists on the ground during an outbreak to rapidly study the pathogen genome without necessarily knowing what it is they are looking for. 5320 Characters (with spaces) -------- Publication : Metagenomic Sequencing at the Epicenter of the Nigeria 2018 Lassa fever Outbreak Link: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6422/74 About BNITM: The Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM) is Germany’s largest institution for research, services and training in the field of tropical diseases and emerging infections.

Umar Tanko Almakura, Chair National Lassa fever Steering Committee Nigeria - Professor Oyewale Tomori, Chief Medical Director Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Nigeria - Prof. Sylvanus Okogbenin, Technical Team Lead National Lassa Fever Working Group - Mrs. Elsie Ilori, Team lead – VHF World Health Organization (WHO) - Dr. Pierre Formenty, Head of Virology Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine Germany - Prof. Stephan Gunther, Head of Virology Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research University of Ghana Accra - Prof. William Kwabena Ampofo, Director UK Public Health Rapid Support Team - Prof. Daniel Bausch, Team Leader for Implementation Research Initiative for Vaccine Research WHO - Dr. Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, Director Africa Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases Redeemers University - Prof. Christian Happi, and Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) - Richard J. Hatchett, MD. The first Lassa Fever International Conference is also an opportunity to increase global health focus on the disease, which is found mostly in West Africa. Sierra Leone, Benin Republic, Liberia, Nigeria and Guinea continue to record cases and deaths from Lassa fever annually. As awareness and disease surveillance systems improve across these countries, mores cases are being detected. This has created an increased sense of urgency for the global health community to do more through better prevention, disease detection, control and case management efforts. In 2018, the World Health Organization launched its Research and Development blueprint, highlighting the potential of Lassa Fever and a selected list of diseases to lead to public health emergencies. This plan highlights the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines, and further highlights the urgent need for accelerated research and development. At the Lassa Fever International Conference, a global audience will learn about efforts towards new strategies to prevent transmission of the virus from rodents to human, new approaches to mitigating hospital transmission of the disease as well as new insights into the social context of Lassa transmission. Current efforts on new Lassa fever vaccines, therapeutics and clinical treatment approaches will also be key highlights at the conference. To prepare for the conference, NCDC called for scientific efforts into prevention, detection and control efforts to be showcased at the conference. This yielded over 500 abstracts from which 160 top quality papers were selected. In addition, travel scholarships were granted to 80 researchers from across Nigeria and West Africa. The Lassa Fever International Conference brings stakeholders together for a meeting full of learning and exchange of ideas. With this, NCDC will work with partners to develop a strong reform agenda for Lassa fever control in Nigeria and globally. ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases. Its core mandate is to detect, investigate, prevent and control diseases of national and international public health importance.

This is following the intensive response to the Lassa fever outbreak declared in Nigeria on the 21st of January 2019. Since the beginning of the outbreak, NCDC has activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate response activities. The EOC includes representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, Médecins Sans Frontières, UK Public Health Rapid Support Team, US Centers for Disease Control and other partners. In addition, state level EOCs were activated in Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi and Plateau. In the last reporting week ending on the 17th February 2019, 25 new confirmed cases of Lassa fever were reported. So far, a total of 355 confirmed cases with 75 deaths have been recorded between January 1st and February 17th, 2019 from 20 states across 57 Local Government Areas. Over the past three weeks, there has been a downward trend in new cases. The number of new cases being reported are lower, compared to the same period during the 2018 outbreak. Despite the reduction in new cases, response activities are being intensified at the national and state level. Rapid Response Teams (RRTs), which include colleagues from Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and Federal Ministry of Environment are supporting the response in high burden states (Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Plateau and Bauchi). In addition, the NCDC has supported states in ensuring full availability of drugs, personal protective equipment, reagents and other supplies required for case management and diagnosis of Lassa fever. There has been no single stock-out reported in any state. An outbreak review meeting was convened by the NCDC on the 15th of February 2019. The goal was to review response activities, discuss lessons learned and improve outcomes of the outbreak. The review highlighted significant improvement in the 2019 response as evidenced by the early decline in the number of cases when compared to the 2018 outbreak. These improvements have been attributed to various factors including the early deployment of One-Health national RRTs, strengthening of Lassa fever treatment centres, enforcement of environmental sanitation, introduction of the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) ring strategy, risk communications activities, high level advocacy, operational research into response activities, and others. The surveillance data from previous outbreaks indicate that the typical peak transmission season for Lassa fever has not passed. Therefore, Nigerians must continue to practice preventive measures to avoid infection. Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good community hygiene to discourage rodents from entering homes. Other effective measures include storing grains and other foodstuff in rodent-proof containers, proper disposal of garbage far from the home, and maintaining clean households. All food should be well prepared, and family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons. Healthcare workers are urged to maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever when handling patients, irrespective of their health status. Lassa fever should be considered in patients with fever, headache and malaise, in whom Malaria has been ruled out with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), especially when patients are not getting better. Health workers should adhere to standard precautions including wearing protective apparels when handling suspected Lassa fever patients. The revised Lassa fever case management guidelines are available on the NCDC website, www.ncdc.gov.ng. Lassa fever is a viral infection caused by the Lassa fever virus, primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact, eating food or drinking water contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. Person-to-person transmission is through contact with blood, urine, saliva, throat secretion or semen of an infected person. The disease can be treated, with early presentation to a healthcare facility greatly increasing the chances of survival. Early signs of the disease include sudden fever, sore throat and general body weakness ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases.

In addition, the country has witnessed a reduction in the number of people who have died from the disease, compared to 2018. Interacting with members of the press at a briefing held on the 11th of March 2019, the Director General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, revealed that the NCDC and partners continue to sustain response activities in states across the country, despite progress made so far. An outbreak of Lassa fever was declared in Nigeria on the 21st of January 2019. Since then, 420 confirmed cases and 93 deaths have been reported in 21 States. The national response is being coordinated by the national, multi-sectoral, multi-partner Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) led by NCDC. In addition, NCDC has supported Ebonyi, Edo, Ondo, Plateau and Kebbi states in activating sub-national level EOCs for coordination. Following the large Lassa fever outbreak in 2018, the NCDC together with partners instituted five key measures to ensure improved preparedness in 2019. 1.Trained over one thousand health care workers in the six zones in the country on Lassa fever management, diagnosis and surveillance, together with the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital; 2.Prepositioning of treatment and diagnostic supplies to the 21 states that recorded cases in 2018, treatment centres and laboratories; 3.Publication of Lassa fever messages on three major newspapers, weekly radio shows on Radio Nigeria, and intensive community engagement; 4.High level advocacy visits to State Governments, encouraging them to do more to prevent and respond to cases of Lassa fever; 5.Developed new case management guidelines, initiated a Lassa fever Research Consortium and hosted and International Conference on Lassa Fever to share knowledge. Immediately following the declaration of the 2019 outbreak, Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) comprising officers from the NCDC, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and Federal Ministry of Environment have supported the response in the high burden states of Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Plateau, Bauchi and Taraba states. In these states, NCDC has also supported full availability of drugs, personal protective equipment, laboratory reagents and other supplies required for case management and diagnosis of Lassa fever. This year, there has been no single stock-out reported in any state. In January 2019, NCDC hosted the first Lassa fever International Conference. This brought together the largest gathering of researchers and professionals to discuss progress on Lassa fever. Importantly, Nigeria introduced her national Lassa fever research plan and has been recognised as one of the leading stakeholders in global Lassa fever research. Over the last six months, progress has been made in this area especially in discussions around Lassa fever vaccines. In the next one year, Nigeria is expected to be part of clinical trials towards the development of Lassa fever vaccines. In 2018, genetic sequencing carried out at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital showed that the virus circulating originated from the pool of lineages that have been in Nigeria since the first discovery. This year, early sequencing result shows similar findings. The preliminary results of 42 Lassa fever virus sequences indicate that rodent to human transmission, as observed in 2018, is still the dominant route of transmission. Therefore, there is a strong need to improve prevention measures especially around environmental sanitation. The progress recorded in the response to the 2019 Lassa fever outbreak including an early decline in the number of new cases and reduced case fatality have been attributed to various factors. This includes the early deployment of One-Health national RRTs, improvement of functions in Lassa fever treatment centres, revision of case management guidelines, enforcement of environmental sanitation in some states, introduction of the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) ring strategy, targeted intensified risk communications activities, high level advocacy visits, operational research into response activities, amongst others. We are grateful to our partners including the World Health Organization, UK Public Health Rapid Support Team, Medecins Sans Frontiers, World Bank, ALIMA, African Field Epidemiology Network. We also applaud the efforts of state epidemiologists, treatment centres and laboratories in the country, especially the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Edo, Federal Medical Centre Owo, Ondo and Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, Ebonyi. It is very important that Nigerians continue to practice preventive measures to avoid infection.

Globally, World Meningitis Day is observed on the 24th of April every year to raise awareness about this dreadful but preventable disease. Meningitis is the inflammation of the membranes, known as meninges, that protect the brain and spinal cord from infection and direct physical injury. The infection of the meninges by microorganisms such as bacteria or viruses results in the condition known as Meningitis, a very serious infection that can lead to death if left untreated. This year, the NCDC seeks to increase awareness on the signs, symptoms and the devastating after-effects that it can have, the extreme importance of early diagnosis and treatment, and the crucial need to support Meningitis survivors and their families Globally, Meningitis affects about 2.8 million people each year. This disease remains a major public health challenge affecting countries in the African meningitis belt, where Nigeria falls; in 2019, 15 States are currently affected in Nigeria. Meningitis cases have been found to occur through the year in the country with an observed increase during the dry season. The disease is highly contagious and can kill within 24 hours, so recognising the symptoms early and acting fast is crucial. Meningitis can affect anyone, however infants, young children, adolescents and older people are at greatest risk, with major risk factors being overcrowding and poor ventilation. This year’s World Meningitis Day theme is “Life After Meningitis”. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), About 10%–15% of those surviving meningococcal meningitis will suffer from complications, including mental disorders, deafness, palsies and seizures; or disabilities resulting from damages to the nervous system, including hearing loss, learning and behavioural difficulties; and other complications such as loss of sight, limb, and organ damage. Raising awareness of Meningitis and its after-effects is therefore very vital – “We all have a collective responsibility to address this public health challenge. As the agency with the mandate to protect the health of Nigerians, NCDC works closely with the Federal Ministry of Health, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), other relevant agencies and partners to sensitise Nigerians on the disease and coordinate response nationally in the event of an outbreak.” - Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director-General, NCDC. Meningitis can be prevented by avoiding overcrowded places and ensuring adequate ventilation in the home, covering the nose and mouth with a disposable tissue when sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose and disposing used tissues promptly into a waste bin. Form the habit of washing hands frequently with soap under a running water, especially after coughing or sneezing. Early presentation to a health facility and treatment increases chances of survival, so visiting the health facility immediately symptoms is extremely crucial. All health workers are advised to practice standard precautions at all times - wear gloves while handling patients or providing care to an ill relative.", "date_published": "Wednesday, April 24, 2019", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:54"}

This is part of activities to commemorate the 2019 World Hand Hygiene Day in Nigeria. Every year on the 5th of May, the World Health Organisation (WHO) with the collaboration of countries and healthcare facilities all around the world, runs an annual campaign to promote hand hygiene with the slogan “Save Lives: Clean your Hands”. The global movement to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to do so through achieving better health and well-being for all people at all ages, including access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, high-quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. IPC, including hand hygiene, is critical to achieve UHC, as it is a practical and evidence-based approach with a big impact on quality of care and patient safety across all levels of the health system. Recently, the NCDC developed a five-year strategic plan to eradicate Lassa fever in Nigeria. A core component of this strategic plan is to achieve a strong IPC culture across healthcare institutions in Nigeria. The ‘Turn Nigeria Orange’ project is a key activity to achieve this. Leveraging the ‘Turn Nigeria Orange’ project, NCDC will conduct a survey on IPC and Hand hygiene in healthcare institutions across Nigeria and use findings to strengthen the capacity of these healthcare institutions using the WHO Core components. Launching the ‘Turn Nigeria Orange’ project today at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Senator Dr. Lanre A. Tejuoso, Chairman Senate Committee on Health, stated that the Federal Government is concerned at the recent spate of healthcare associated infections: “No healthcare worker in Nigeria should risk his or her life in the discharge of duties in saving the lives of Nigerians. We will work together to strengthen capacity of our healthcare institutions to keep our healthcare workers safe as they work to protect the lives of Nigerians”. In a statement at the launch of the campaign, the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu stressed the importance of this campaign and calls on health facilities to prevent HCAIs through hand hygiene and action on infection prevention and control. “Healthcare associated infections are preventable. NCDC is committed to working with States and healthcare institutions across Nigeria to ensure facilities are equipped and empowered to safeguard all healthcare workers”. The Nigeria Centre for Disease control (NCDC) which has the mandate to prevent, detect and respond to diseases of public health importance has prioritised the implementation of strong IPC culture within healthcare facilities across Nigeria to help control the spread of highly infectious diseases like Lassa fever and other HCAIs. The NCDC continues to strengthen its IPC unit and is also supporting health facilities in setting up IPC programmes. In 2018 the NCDC facilitated a Training of Trainers for 28 healthcare workers from seven private and seven public facilities as IPC change agents. In collaboration with Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany’s national public health institute, and other national IPC stakeholders, NCDC developed an IPC curriculum to guide healthcare workers while delivering healthcare services. Earlier in 2019, the NCDC in collaboration with RKI, commenced the 'NCDC Capacity Development for Preparedness and Response for Infectious Diseases’ (NiCaDe) project to strengthen capacity for IPC in secondary and tertiary health facilities across the country.

On the 22nd of January 2019, the NCDC activated a national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate response activities. This was in response to an increase in Lassa fever cases at the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 578 confirmed cases including 129 deaths have been recorded from 21 states as at 26th of May 2019. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Environment (FMEnv), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), and partners coordinated by WHO Nigeria, has led response activities across the country. Following lessons from the 2018 outbreak, our strategic response included: 1.Improved preparedness through training of health workers across the country and communications campaign before the outbreak. 2.Early deployment of One-Health Rapid Response Teams to affected States and support for surge staff deployment. 3. Establishment of new treatment centres in Kebbi, Benue and Kaduna and strengthening of existing treatment centres. 4.Prepositioning of medical and treatment supplies in all 21 states with confirmed cases in 2018. 5.Improved collaboration with agricultural and environmental health stakeholders and introduction of rodent control strategies. Following a robust response, the Lassa fever case count has significantly declined in the past seven weeks and has now dropped below levels considered to be a national emergency. This year, there was also a decline in case fatality rate of Lassa fever, from 27% in 2018 to 22% in 2019. Despite the end of the emergency phase of this outbreak, NCDC expects that sporadic cases may continue to be reported in endemic areas/hotspots and the agency will now coordinate preparedness and response activities through a multi-sectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group. The group’s focus is to continue monitoring cases, as well as improve disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis and response activities across all levels in Nigeria. According to the Director General (DG) of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the agency will continue to improve its knowledge, preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreaks. “Given that Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. However, we have several research strategies to improve our knowledge of the disease. We are also working with states and partners to establish more long-term strategies such as improved risk communication, infection prevention and control, regular environmental sanitation, enhanced capacity of health workers and improvement of treatment centres among others”. The Officer-in-Charge of the World Health Organization in Nigeria, Dr. Clement Peter-Lasuba added that \"The WHO remains committed to working with the Government of Nigeria and other partners to sustain and improve Nigeria’s capacity to detect, prepare for and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks including implementing a Lassa fever research plan and other control strategies”. The NCDC remains very grateful to all its partners including WHO, UNICEF, Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), UK Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK-PHRST), Alliance for Medical Action (ALIMA), Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and Bernard Nocht Institute (BNI) in Germany, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), George Town University, eHealth Africa, Pro Health International (PHI), ECHO, International Federation of Red cross Communities, World Bank, Japanese Government, PANDORA and other organisations. We also thank the State Ministries of Health and the health workers for their hard work and dedication during this outbreak.

The Nigeria Ebola Preparedness team, coordinated by the NCDC, has conducted a preliminary risk assessment following the recent confirmation of EVD in Kasese District of Uganda. On 11th of June 2019, the Ugandan Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of EVD in Kasese District, at the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The index case was a 5-year old boy who fell ill after a visit to Mabalako Health Zone in Democratic Republic of the Congo to attend the burial of his grand-father, a confirmed EVD case, who died in the community on 1st of June 2019. As at 12th June 2019, the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) has confirmed three (03) cases of EVD and one (01) death recorded. A total of eight contacts have been identified and are being closely monitored. As at 14th June 2019, ring vaccination for high risk contacts and frontline healthcare workers is currently ongoing. The district taskforce on EVD, a national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), WHO Uganda Country Office and Partners are supporting the response in the country. Outbreaks of EVD are known to bear risk of international spread hence the rationale for continual evaluation of Nigeria’s potential risk amidst regional trade and flight route within the region. Based on available data, the overall risk of importation of EVD to Nigeria remains low. This is also in line with WHO’s risk assessment for Nigeria. There are no direct commercial flights and no known direct trade routes to Nigeria from Uganda. The current transmission pathway of the disease in Uganda is through unmanned land borders and further away from the capitals of both Uganda and Nigeria. However, the Nigeria Ebola Preparedness Team has put in place several measures to ensure adequate preparedness. Our national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), situated at the Incident Coordination Centre (ICC) in NCDC Abuja, is functional and currently in Alert Mode for EVD. Our team of national first responders are on standby and ready for deployment within 24 hours when the need arises. Public Health EOCs (PHEOCs) in States where major points of entry are located (Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt) are also on standby. We have improved point-of-entry screenings in major airports; the Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health is on alert and has heightened screening measures at entry points at our ports. In addition to the above, designated treatment centres and isolation facilities have been identified. Nigeria currently has in-country capacity for the diagnosis of EVD within NCDC’s National Reference Laboratories. Our risk communications technical working group has developed an All Infectious Diseases Risk Communication Plan, and coordinates with a network of media houses and Health Educators in all States for prompt information dissemination. There are currently ongoing Infection Prevention Control (IPC) programs nationwide, including the development of new guidelines, as well as training packages for health care workers to mitigate transmission. Ebola Virus Disease, also known as Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by Ebola viruses. It is caused by an infection with one of five known Ebola virus species, four of which can cause disease in humans. The virus can be transmitted via direct contact with bodily fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from EVD. The virus can enter the body stream through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth and can also be spread through contact with objects contaminated by infected persons as well as direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected fruit bats or primates. To prevent the spread of Ebola, the NCDC advises members of the public to adhere to the following precautions: •Wash your hands frequently using soap and water – use hand sanitizers when soap and water is not readily available •Avoid direct handling of dead wild animals •Avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection with an unknown diagnosis •Make sure fruit and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them Health care workers are advised to ensure universal precautions at all times. This includes the use of personal protective equipment always when handling patients. The NCDC is working closely with colleagues at the World Health Organisation Nigeria Country Office, who are in close contact with WHO African Region and Ministries of Health in Uganda and DR Congo, to determine the risk of spread to other African countries. Our multi-sectoral technical working group has heightened situational awareness on the ongoing outbreak in both countries. NCDC remains fully committed and capable of protecting the health of all Nigerians from infectious disease outbreaks.

RTSL is a global public health initiative that works with governments to implement strategies for epidemic prevention and improved national health security. Since 2017, RTSL has supported key areas of work carried out by NCDC, especially following Nigeria’s Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of International Health Regulations (IHR) in 2017. Specifically, the organisation has supported the development and implementation of the National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS), strengthening of the national yellow fever/measles/rubella laboratory network as well as development of programme management capacity and broad institutional development. Following the successful collaboration, the President and CEO of RTSL, Dr. Tom Frieden, spoke at a symposium held in his honour and to officially launch the collaboration with NCDC in Abuja. He said, “During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, Nigeria’s rapid control measures in Lagos showed that readiness saves lives and prevents spread of epidemics, protecting the country, continent, and world. I’m encouraged by NCDC’s commitment to build on that experience and strengthen Nigeria’s ability to find, stop and prevent epidemics. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with NCDC and other key stakeholders to support Nigeria’s work to improve preparedness for the next epidemic.” The Director General of the NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu expressed his appreciation for the strong collaboration with RTSL, stating “The work done by Resolve in tracking countries progress across JEE areas is unique and critical. For us at NCDC, the support has helped us to identify gaps, develop realistic activities and work towards the goals to mitigate these gaps in our health security capacity”. The collaboration between NCDC and RTSL will expand in 2019, to include support for sub-national health security, towards strengthening national and global health security.

WHAT IS CHOLERA? Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes acute watery diarrhoea in children and adults which if left untreated can lead to death within hours. It is endemic in Nigeria with cases occurring mainly during the rainy season, usually between April and September. This is primarily as a result of contamination of food and drinking water supplies by the faeces of infected people. TRANSMISSION Cholera which is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food and water. Risk factors for transmission include overcrowded environments (e.g. urban slums and camps for internally displaced people or refugees), poor sanitation and hygiene practices, lack of potable water, and open defecation. SYMPTOMS Majority of infected people either have no symptoms or display mild symptoms with only about one in ten of them showing the characteristic symptoms of rapid onset of profuse watery diarrhoea (rice water stools), with or without vomiting within a few days of infection. Other symptoms include: •Nausea and weakness with clinical features of dehydration which may include increased thirst, dry eyes and mouth, muscle cramps, lethargy and tachycardia. Complications can develop quickly—within a matter of hours—due to loss of electrolytes and large volume of fluids. •Worrisome clinical features of severe dehydration and electrolyte loss include low blood sugar, hypotension, loss of skin elasticity, fever and chills, changes in breathing pattern, altered mental state, oliguria/anuria, and coma. •If not treated, shock and death can result in a matter of hours highlighting the central importance of prompt evaluation and treatment as necessary. Case fatality ratios can be up to 50% especially in people without access to treatment but this drops to 1% with adequate treatment. People with low immunity – such as malnourished children or people living with HIV – are at a greater risk of death if infected. TREATMENT Cholera is an easily treatable disease, if detected early. Highlighted below are some important clinical points to consider in managing cholera: •The majority of people affected can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS). •Severely dehydrated patients are at risk of shock and require the rapid administration of intravenous fluids, preferably Ringer lactate if available; otherwise normal saline and ORS will suffice •Appropriate antibiotics can be given to severe cases to diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excretion. •Zinc supplementation can significantly reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea in children suffering from cholera or any acute watery diarrhoea, and should be started immediately. For children below 6 months of age, add zinc 10mg daily for 2 weeks. For children from 6 months to 12 years, add zinc 20mg daily for 2 weeks. •Ensure strict Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures to control the spread. Persons caring for cholera patients can avoid acquiring the illness by washing their hands after touching anything that might be contaminated and properly disposing of contaminated items and human waste. Counsel patients and relatives on the following precautionary measures: •Water should be boiled, stored in a clean and safe container before drinking •Ensure that the seals of bottled water are in place before storage or consumption •Wash hands frequently with soap and clean running water. Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser if soap and clean water are not available •Ensure food is well cooked before consumption. Avoid raw food such as fruits and vegetables, except you have washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself. Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping and ensure proper disposal of waste and clearing of sewage Take anyone with the above signs or symptoms to a health care facility immediately", "date_published": "Thursday, July 04, 2019", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:54"}

WHAT IS CHOLERA? Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes profuse diarrhoea in children and adults which if left untreated can lead to death within hours. There is usually an increase in the number of cholera cases during the rainy season, mainly between April and September. This is primarily as a result of surface run-offs where contaminated faeces are washed into water bodies which are used as water sources. Cholera which is caused by the germ Vibrio cholerae, is spread by ingestion of contaminated food and water. The disease is common in overcrowded environments (e.g. urban slums and camps for internally displaced people or refugees), areas with poor sanitation and hygiene practices, lack of potable water, and open defecation. SYMPTOMS Cholera is characterised by sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, which can lead to sudden death as a result of dehydration, if not managed on time. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Most infected people may only show mild symptoms or have no symptom at all. TREATMENT Cholera is an easily treatable disease, if detected early. Most infected people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS), with the goal to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. The ORS solution is available as a powder that can be reconstituted in boiled or bottled water. Without rehydration, approximately half the people with cholera die. With treatment, the number of fatalities drops to less than 1 percent. Severely dehydrated people may also need intravenous fluids. 5 PREVENTION TIPS To reduce the spread of cholera, the NCDC advises that precautionary measures should be taken, and offers the following five priority actions for Nigerians to follow: 1.Ensure that water is boiled and stored in a clean and safe container before drinking. Ensure that the seals of bottled water are in place 2.Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean running water. Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser if soap and clean water are not available 3.Ensure that food is well cooked before consumption. Avoid raw food such as fruits and vegetables, except you have washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself. 4.Avoid open defecation, indiscriminate refuse dumping and ensure proper disposal of waste and frequent clearing of sewage 5.If you experience sudden watery diarrhoea, please do not self-medicate, visit a health care facility immediately and take all sick persons with the signs or symptoms above to a health care facility immediately NCDC and its partners, especially the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and Médecin Sans Frontières (MSF) will continue to support the response to cholera. We advise an increased focus on the provision of potable water, adequate sanitation and institution of good hygiene practices (WaSH). States are encouraged to ensure early reporting of suspected cases, adequate preparedness including provision of WaSH facilities, medical supplies, and institution of appropriate management of cases.", "date_published": "Thursday, July 04, 2019", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:54"}

In 2017, the most recent year for which estimates are available, measles caused approximately 110 000 deaths. Even in high-income countries, complications result in hospitalization in up to a quarter of cases, and can lead to lifelong disability, from brain damage and blindness to hearing loss. The best protection against the disease is through receiving two doses of the measles vaccine, which is often incorporated with mumps and/or rubella vaccines. The first sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about 10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus and lasts 4 to 7 days. A runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease which include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or respiratory infections such as pneumonia. RISK OF INFECTION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELLERS Over recent months, spikes in case numbers have occurred including in countries with high overall vaccination coverage as the disease has spread fast among clusters of unvaccinated people. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person from 4 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications. Any non-immune person (i.e. who has not been vaccinated with 2 doses of measles containing vaccine) can become infected. TRAVEL-RELATED RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT THE INTERNATIONAL SPREAD OF MEASLES ¥Recent outbreaks of measles highlight gaps in protection against the disease among children and adults. All travellers should check that their vaccination status is up-to-date and ensure that they have received two doses of measles vaccine. ¥Travellers who are uncertain of their measles vaccination status should receive at least one dose of measles vaccine. WHO recommends that travellers get vaccinated against measles at least 15 days prior to travel. ¥Measles vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines recommended for travellers such as yellow fever vaccine. ¥WHO recommends that infants from six months of age receive a supplementary dose of measles vaccine if they are travelling to countries experiencing measles outbreaks. Children between 6 and 9 months of age who receive a supplementary dose of measles vaccine should also receive two doses of measles vaccine at the recommended ages according to the national immunisation schedule. ¥All travellers should seek advice from their healthcare provider and be aware of the risk of exposure to measles virus as well as transmission and symptoms of the disease. ¥Measles vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women.", "date_published": "Friday, July 12, 2019", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:54"}

The NAAW is an annual national campaign to increase awareness across all sectors on the global threat of antibiotic resistance and to promote best practice of antibiotics usage among the general public, health workers and policy makers. The week is marked to increase awareness and prevent the further emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Nigeria’s commemoration is part of activities to observe the 2019 World Antibiotics Awareness Week. Antibiotics are used worldwide in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals. The effectiveness of antibiotics has also been its biggest challenge. The ease of access and overuse of antibiotics have resulted in an increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, which is paradoxically leading to a loss of effectiveness. Antimicrobial resistance is a situation where micro-organisms treated with antibiotics develop immunity or become resistant to antibiotics due to misuse of the drugs. The emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms has led to an increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance in every region of the world affecting people of all ages and status. This can be reduced by a more targeted, responsible approach to the use of antibiotics. With a series of planned activities, Nigeria will mark the week from the 18th to the 24th of November, 2019 to spread awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance, as well as promote responsible use of antibiotics among the general public. A major activity to mark the week is the launch of a digital platform to document pledges from Nigerians to undertake behaviours encouraging responsible use of antibiotics. This is with the support of Public Health England, the UK’s public health institute. The platform, the Antibiotic Guardian Pledge (antibioticguardian.com/africa), is targeted at policy makers, health care professionals, students, farmers and Nigerians at large. It curates a set of pledges and encourages participants to commit to a pledge to ensure responsible use of antibiotics. Other events to commemorate the 2019 National Antibiotics Awareness Week include: ●An awareness walk in Abuja, bringing partners and stakeholders together to create awareness on antimicrobial resistance in Nigeria and promote responsible antibiotic use. ●A Twitter campaign on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to spread key messages on the social media in Nigeria using the hashtag #AMRactionNG and #NAAW2019. This holds on Monday 18th November and is open to the public. ●A Twitter chat with the Africa CDC, Public Health England and the NCDC on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will take place on Wednesday, 20th November, 2019. Join the conversation on Twitter using the hashtags #AfricaWAAW, #NAAW2019 and #AMRactionNG. ●A training session organised for members of the media on how to report AMR accurately. ●Awareness visits to abattoir and livestock markets on Wednesday, 20th November, 2019. ●A training workshop for laboratory scientists on AMR at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja. ●An inter-secondary school debate to engage young people. Nigeria has successfully achieved milestones in the national fight against AMR. In November 2017, Nigeria conducted a situation analysis on the state of antimicrobial resistance in the country and developed a national action plan to build on strengths and address gaps identified in results from the analysis. In 2018, Nigeria began reporting actively to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), an initiative developed to support the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance. In the same year at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Nigeria pledged and committed to scaling up national surveillance on AMR as part of the global AMR Challenge. This includes the development and distribution of a national toolkit for AMR stewardship in healthcare institutions in the country, as well as implementation of infection prevention and control programmes across health institutions. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control remains committed to protecting the health of Nigerians from the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.

Following a report of cases and deaths from fever of unknown origin in Izzi Local Government Area (LGA) in Ebonyi State, the State public health team commenced investigation. As at the 31st of July 2019, three cases had tested positive for Yellow fever at NCDC’s National Reference Laboratory, which triggered an immediate response. The Ebonyi State Epidemiology Team is leading the response with support from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). In the course of investigation, it was discovered that between May 1 and August 7, 2019, there had been cases that fit into the case definition for Yellow fever and 20 deaths in Izzi LGA, Ebonyi State, indicating that the outbreak may have been going on for a few months undetected by local health authorities. It was too late to collect samples for confirmation from these cases. Immediately it was notified, NCDC deployed a rapid response team to support Ebonyi State with contact tracing, case finding, risk communications and the management of cases. Detailed analysis and plans are in advanced stages to apply to the international vaccine stockpile to enable a reactive vaccination campaign in Ebonyi state, in response to the cluster of cases. Yellow fever virus is spread through bites of an infected mosquito. There is no human-to-human transmission of the virus. Yellow fever is a completely vaccine preventable disease and a single shot provides immunity for a lifetime. The Yellow fever vaccine is available for free in primary health care centres in Nigeria as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Every child is protected for life if vaccinated. We encourage every family to ensure that children receive all their childhood vaccines. In addition to the vaccine, the public are advised to keep their environments clean and free of stagnant water to discourage the breeding of mosquitoes and use insecticide treated mosquito nets, screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquito bites. It is important to avoid self-medication: visit a health facility immediately if you feel ill. Since September 2017, Nigeria has recorded suspected cases of Yellow fever in all States in the country. As at the 31st of July 2019, 78 cases have been laboratory confirmed in Nigeria in 2019 alone. A multi-agency Yellow fever technical working group coordinated by NCDC, has been leading the investigation and response to Yellow fever cases. The National Primary Health Care Agency is leading efforts to provide an additional opportunity of vaccination through preventive vaccination campaigns across the country. Healthcare workers are reminded that the symptoms of Yellow fever include yellowness of the eyes, sudden fever, headache and body pain.

Three of the confirmed cases are residents of Alkaleri Local Government Area (LGA) and the fourth case is a tourist who was visiting Kano State and also visited the Yankari Games Reserve in the same LGA in Bauchi State. NCDC was first notified on the 29th of August, when we received the report of a confirmed case of Yellow Fever in Kano State from a laboratory in our Yellow Fever laboratory network. Subsequent investigations led by the Kano State Epidemiology Team established that this confirmed case of yellow fever was from a patient who visited the Yankari Game Reserve in Bauchi, in August 2019 with his father. Unfortunately, the father died with similar symptoms before a sample could be collected and tested. Subsequently, on the 3rd of September 2019, the Borno State Epidemiology Team reported deaths among students of Waka College of Education in Biu LGA Borno State. These students visited the Yankari Game Resort in August 2019. Of the 95 Students that visited the resort, eight of them developed symptoms and six had died as at the time of the report. The others are in a stable condition. Samples from these cases are being tested. Intensification of surveillance activities has led to the identification of three more confirmed cases who are all resident in Alkaleri Local Government Area (LGA), of Bauchi state. Altogether, we can confirm four cases of yellow fever in people that either live or have visited Bauchi in the last one month. Since it was notified, the NCDC has collaborated with the State epidemiologists of the affected States and the World Health Organization country office to investigate these events. We have also deployed a rapid response team to support Bauchi State to carry out further in-depth investigations, including case finding, risk communications, and support the management of cases. Samples of the other suspected cases from Bauchi and Borno states are currently being transported to the NCDC National Reference Laboratory in Abuja for further testing.

The conference with the theme “APPLIED EPIDEMIOLOGY: Providing Evidence for Public Health Action” will bring together the best minds in the field to assess the impact of field epidemiology on public health and outbreak response in Nigeria and globally, and the use of applied epidemiological methods to provide evidence for decision making to drive precise public health action. Plenary speakers at this year’s conference include notable thought leaders in global public health speaking on insightful topics around health security, laboratory surveillance, philanthropist interventions in health emergencies, preventing and preparing for epidemics as well as utilising social media for health emergencies. The keynote speaker is the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Faisal Shuaib. The 4th NCDC/NFELTP Annual Scientific Conference addresses 11 main themes including outbreak investigation, emergency preparedness and response, vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization strategies, surveillance and information management systems, neglected tropical diseases, malaria and other vector-borne diseases, risk communication, and public health systems strengthening. Since 2016, the NCDC and the NFELTP has held the annual scientific conference to provide a platform for experts working in epidemiology to measure progress, identify new opportunities for real-life application of concepts, impart new knowledge and skills to advance public health science; and to reflect on lessons learnt in our response to disease outbreaks and other public health priorities in Nigeria. The Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme is run by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, in partnership with the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), in collaboration with the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria and the University of Ibadan, with the support of the United States Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (US-CDC). The programme works with the Ministries of Health and Ministries of Agriculture at the Federal and State levels to develop public health capacity, strengthen health systems and respond to disease epidemics and other priority public health issues in the country. Since 2008, the NFELTP has recorded several success stories. During the 2014-2016 Ebola pandemic, apart from curtailing the spread locally, NCDC’s technical staff and NFELTP-trained field epidemiologists also supported other affected West African countries to successful control the pandemic. Also, the program has been critical to Nigeria’s successful control of various disease outbreaks such as cerebrospinal meningitis, Lassa fever, measles, yellow fever, cholera, and monkeypox over the years.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/200/yellow-fever-faqs", "title": "Yellow Fever FAQs", "body": "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON YELLOW FEVER What is yellow fever? •Yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus and is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. It is called 'yellow fever' because in serious cases, the skin or eyes turn yellow in colour. Where does yellow fever virus occur? •Yellow fever virus is found in tropical countries in South America and Africa including Nigeria. How soon do people get sick after being bitten by an infected mosquito? •The time from the bite of an infected mosquito to beginning of illness (incubation period) is usually between 3-6 days. What are the symptoms of yellow fever? •Sudden fever/chills •Severe headache •Back pain •Muscle pain •General body aches •Nausea and vomiting •Fatigue and weakness In severe cases, a person may develop: •High fever •Jaundice (a condition that involves yellow discolouration of the skin and the eyes) •Internal bleeding (especially from the digestive tract), leading to eventual shock and failure of many organs like the kidney and liver How can I protect my family and self from contracting yellow fever? •The most effective way to protect yourself and your family is by getting vaccinated against yellow fever. Is the vaccine safe? •Yes, the yellow fever vaccine is safe and very effective. One shot of the vaccine gives protection for life. Who should be vaccinated against Yellow Fever? •The yellow fever vaccine is essential for everyone from 9 months of age living in a yellow fever endemic country (like Nigeria). Do I need another dose of the vaccine after the first vaccination? •No, you don’t need a booster dose. Research has proven that a single shot of the vaccine protects against the disease for a life time. However, everyone is encouraged to get vaccinated during mass vaccination campaigns if carried out in your area, irrespective of your status. Where can adults go for vaccination in states? •For adults, the vaccine is affordable and readily available in health care facilities nationwide. Is the yellow fever vaccine free? •The yellow fever vaccine is free for children from 9 months old and is available as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule in government owned/public health facilities across the country. The vaccines are also administered free for everyone during mass vaccination campaigns. Will there be any side effects when I get vaccinated? •Reactions to yellow fever vaccine are generally mild. They can include: Mild headaches, Muscle aches, Low- grade fevers What do I do if I experience severe reactions after taking the vaccine? •If you experience severe reactions, please consult your healthcare provider or go back to the vaccination post IMMEDIATELY. How can one get the vaccination card? •All vaccinated persons are given the International Certificate of Vaccination and Prophylaxis (ICVP, called the yellow card) as evidence upon vaccination except for children who take the vaccine during routine immunisation. Do I need a yellow fever vaccination to travel to other countries? •Yes, it is important to be vaccinated against yellow fever at least 10 days before traveling to or from a yellow fever endemic country. Where can international travellers get vaccinated? •International travellers can get vaccinated at least 10 days before departure at any Ports Health Service (PHS) office nationwide and obtain a valid vaccination card as evidence. If you have travelled through a yellow fever endemic country, and you do not have a valid yellow fever vaccination certiﬁcate, you risk being refused entry into many countries or may be required to be vaccinated upon arrival in those countries. Who should not receive the yellow fever vaccine? •Infants younger than 9 months of age •Adults above 60 years •Anyone with a severe allergy to any part of the vaccine, including eggs, chicken proteins, or gelatin should not get the vaccine If you have any of the following conditions, your healthcare provider can help you decide whether you can safely receive the vaccine: •HIV/AIDS or other disease that affects the immune system •Weakened immune system as a result of cancer or other medical conditions, transplant, or drug treatment (such as steroids, chemotherapy, or others that affect immune function) •Pregnant women and nursing mothers If I successfully recover from yellow fever, can I get re-infected in the future? •No you cannot be infected again. The disease confers natural immunity for those who recover from it. How is yellow fever diagnosed? •Yellow fever is diagnosed through a blood test done in a designated public health reference laboratory. Is there a cure for yellow fever? •There is no speciﬁc treatment for yellow fever. However, supportive treatment can be provided; medicines can be used to relieve the symptoms and may improve the outcome for seriously ill patients if presented early at health facility.

Of the samples tested from these cases, 83 were confirmed positive in Katsina (43), Bauchi (34) and Benue (6). Since the beginning of the year, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) have been working with development partners to support the states to prevent and reduce the number of cases and deaths. This year, Katsina State has recorded 599 suspected cases, 43 confirmed cases and 77 deaths among suspected cases. A mass vaccination campaign was carried out in the State in September 2019. Bauchi State has been reporting suspected cases of yellow fever mostly in Alkaleri LGA. This year, the State has recorded 183 suspected cases, 34 confirmed cases and 24 deaths among suspected cases. Following the outbreak in Alkaleri LGA, a reactive vaccination campaign was carried out. Benue State has recorded 150 suspected cases, six confirmed cases and no death in 2019. Vaccination campaigns have been carried out in three LGAs of the state this year- Vandekiya LGA in January 2019, Oju and Ado LGAs in September 2019. In response to the increase in cases, a multi-agency yellow fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated on the 5th of November 2019. Three Rapid Response Team (RRTs) have been deployed to Katsina, Bauchi and Benue this week to support the outbreak response. Working together, NPHCDA, NCDC and development partners recently implemented yellow fever mass vaccination campaigns in Alkaleri LGA of Bauchi, two LGAs of Benue (Oju and Ado) and all the LGAs in Katsina.

Large outbreaks occur when infected people introduce the virus into densely populated communities with high concentration of mosquitoes and low to no vaccination coverage. In such situations, the virus is transmitted from person to person through bites from an infected mosquito. Yellow fever can easily be misdiagnosed because the symptoms are very similar to those of malaria. The symptoms mainly include, fever, muscle or joint pain, headache, loss of appetite and vomiting. In severe cases yellowing of the eyes (jaundice) and unexplained bleeding from the mouth, nose or eyes may occur. There is no direct human-to-human transmission of the disease. However, the Aedes specie mosquito can transmit yellow fever from an infected person to an unvaccinated person. Yellow fever is completely vaccine-preventable. A single dose of the vaccine provides lifetime protection against the disease. The vaccine is free for children from 9 months to 2 years as part of the national routine immunisation schedule in all government health facilities across the country. International travelers can receive the vaccine from Port Health Services at the points of entry (POE) or their respective offices in the country. Adults in-country can get the vaccine at an affordable cost from health facilities nationwide. Risk of Infection for International Travelers With globalisation, the ease of migration has increased, making it possible for people seeking new opportunities to travel in and out of areas endemic for yellow fever, and also at risk of developing the disease if unvaccinated, or spreading it if infected. Occasionally unvaccinated people working, hiking or travelling in jungles or forest get bitten by infected mosquitoes and develop yellow fever. This can lead to further transmission among urban populations (spread by the Aedes species of mosquito). Travel-Related Recommendations to Prevent the International Spread of Yellow Fever •The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends travellers to get the yellow fever vaccine atleast 10 days before travelling to prevent risk of importation or exportation of the virus. The vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines recommended for travelers, such as measles and oral polio vaccine. •Travellers should obtain the International Certificate of Vaccination and Prophylaxis (ICVP, also known as Yellow Card) as proof of immunisation to allow for access into various countries. •Travellers should stay protected from mosquito bites through the use of insect repellants and insecticides and ensuring good environmental sanitation at all times. •The vaccine is essential for anyone between 9 months and 60 years of age. •WHO does not recommend the vaccine for the following group of people: oPregnant women (except during an outbreak with recommendation from a doctor) oPeople who have severe allergies to egg or a previous life threatening reaction to the vaccine oPeople with severe immune deficiency (e.g. due to symptomatic HIV/AIDS) About NCDC and Port Health Services The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases. Its core mandate is to detect, investigate, prevent and control diseases of national and international public health importance. Port Health Services or PHS (a division of the Federal Ministry of Health) is the competent public health authority at Nigeria’s Points of Entry (PoE) responsible for infectious disease surveillance, implementing WHO International Health Regulations, public health and other relevant laws, public health related exit and entry control, and ensuring a sanitary environment at the PoE.

This is a 7% increase from the 2017 score of 39%. In 2017, Nigeria conducted a Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of her IHR capacities. These regulations are global standards of countries’ preparedness to tackle public health threats. This was coordinated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as the IHR National Focal Point, with close involvement of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) whose functions are related to national health security. The normal duration of this is five years. Two years after the first JEE, a mid-term assessment has been carried out to review progress and gaps since 2017, as well as priorities towards improving national health security. From the 18th - 21st of November 2019, key stakeholders from 29 MDAs involved in health security used the World Health Organization (WHO) approved tool with 49 indicators to assess Nigeria’s capacity in the 19 technical areas. This was validated by a mission Team from the World Health Organisation, Public Health England, Resolve to Save Lives, US Centers for Disease Control, Georgetown University, African Field Epidemiology Network, ProHealth International and University of Maryland Baltimore. The findings from the JEE show that Nigeria has made some progress since 2017. This is especially in areas such as legislation, policy and financing; zoonotic disease; biosafety and biosecurity; laboratory system; reporting; emergency preparedness; and response operations; medical countermeasures and risk communication. In other areas, there has been no change or a decrease in capacity. Dr. Clement Peter-Lasuba, Officer in Charge of WHO Nigeria recognised Nigeria’s progress. He said “WHO congratulates Nigeria for the successful workshop and recognises the significant progress made which is linked to the strong partnerships and increasing multi-sectoral approach employed. However, more needs to be done to attain full capacities to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats in the country. I encourage even more contributions from the Federal and State governments as well as partners to enable Nigeria to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal -related targets”. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the Director General of the NCDC, in his remarks reinforced the need for improved multi-sectoral effort to protect the health of Nigerians. “We are grateful for another opportunity to work collaboratively with our colleagues from other MDAs. It is very important for us to maintain and strengthen our multi-sectoral collaboration for health security. We are only as strong as our weakest link so progress in only one sector alone is not the progress we need. We have to take everyone along”. Receiving the results for Nigeria, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, the Honourable Minister of Health, reiterated the federal government’s commitment to health security in Nigeria, and thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his unwavering commitment. “Since the first JEE, we have made progress, progress with which I am very pleased. I am impressed with the leadership of the NCDC in their implementation of the IHR in Nigeria. I shall ensure that all relevant agencies and government departments work towards ensuring that the results of this evaluation are discussed with leaders of the Ministries and Agencies involved, to ensure prioritisation and mobilisation of adequate resources to strengthen Nigeria’s health security”. The JEE process has provided an opportunity to understand current gaps and identify priorities to mitigate this. This can be implemented with strong multi-sectoral collaboration.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/206/lassa-fever-public-health-advisory", "title": "Lassa Fever Public Health Advisory", "body": "Lassa fever Public Health Advisory, 08 December 2019. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) caused by the Lassa virus. The natural reservoir for the virus is the Mastomys natalensis rodent (commonly known as the multimammate rat). Other rodents have also been identified who carry the virus. Lassa fever remains a major public health challenge in West Africa with Nigeria bearing the highest burden. Lassa fever occurs throughout the year but more cases are recorded during the dry season i.e. November through May. Lassa fever is spread through: 1. Direct contact with urine, faces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 2. Contact with objects, household items and surfaces or eating food, contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. 3. Person to person transmission by contact with blood, urine, faeces, vomitus, and other body fluids of an infected person. Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever: Lassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria. Its symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, general body weakness, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, chest pain, and in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nose, mouth and other body openings. The time between an infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease is 3 to 21 days. Early treatment and diagnosis increases the chances of survival. People most at risk are: - People of all age groups who come in contact with the urine, faeces, saliva or blood of rats - People living in rat infested environments which increases their chances of coming in contact with rats - People who consume potentially contaminated food stuff especially those left open overnight or dried outside in the open - People who handle or process rodents for consumption - People who do not perform hand hygiene when appropriate - Relatives who care for sick person with unexplained illnesses at home - Health care workers including: - - Doctors, nurses and other health workers providing direct patient care in the absence of standard precautions. - - Hospital staff who clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies without adequate protective gear - - Laboratory staff who handle blood samples of suspected Lassa fever patients without appropriate precautions - - Medical or support staff who prepare and or handle dead bodies without appropriate precautions. To reduce the risk of Lassa fever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) offers the following advice: • Ensure proper environmental sanitation – i.e. keep your environment clean at all times, block all holes in your house to prevent rats from entry. • Cover your dustbins and dispose refuse properly. Communities should setup dump sites very far from their homes to reduce the chances of having rodents within homes • Store foodstuff like rice, garri, beans, corn/maize etc. containers which are well covered with tight fitting lids • Avoid drying food stuff outside on the floor, roadside where it will be exposed to contamination • Avoid bush burning which can lead to displacement of rats from bushes to human dwellings • Eliminate rats in homes and communities by setting rat traps and other means • Practice good personal hygiene by frequent washing hands with soap under running water/or use of hand sanitisers when appropriate • Visit the nearest health facility if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever as mentioned earlier, avoid self-medication • Healthcare workers are advised to practice standard precautions at all times: i.e. wearing gloves while handling patients or providing care to an ill patient/relative. • Healthcare workers should maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever i.e. be vigilant and lookout for signs and symptoms of Lassa fever. Any febrile illness that has not responded to 48 hours use of anti-malaria or antibiotics should raise an index of suspicion for Lassa fever! Please if your healthcare worker suspects Lassa fever, advise him or her to contact your local government disease surveillance and notification officer to access care in Nigeria.

The plan which was jointly developed by the Federal Ministries of Health, Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), and Environment as well as their agencies, reinforces Nigeria’s commitment to strengthen a multi-sectoral collaboration for health security. This plan will be implemented over a five-year period (2018 - 2023). The health of humans and animals are interlinked with the environment. Majority of infectious diseases that affect human health are zoonotic i.e. originate from animals, and occur at the human-animal-environment interface. Nigeria continues to experience annual outbreaks of zoonotic diseases including Lassa fever, monkeypox and yellow fever. The new One Health strategic plan launched in Abuja by the Honourable Minister of State for Health, outlines the country’s plan to strengthen the prevention, detection and response to infectious diseases that affect humans, animals and the environment. The plan recognises the interconnectedness of the health of people to the health of animals and the environment, and offers a collaborative, multi-sectoral and transdisciplinary approach for zoonotic diseases. To improve the country’s implementation of the One Health Strategy, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) pledged their continuous support to Nigeria. Both WHO and OIE supported the organisation of the International Health Regulations and Performance of Veterinary Services (IHR-PVS) bridging workshop in Abuja from 9th to 11th of December 2019. The workshop allowed for the review of capacities across the human and animal health sectors. Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch a One Health plan signed by the Ministers of Health Agriculture and Environment. The Honourable Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunnimbe Adeleke Mamora who led the launch of the plan stated, ‘Nigeria has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to manage the outbreaks we experience and offers synergy across our various Ministries. We hope that the implementation of this plan in Nigeria can serve as a model for other African countries’. Speaking at the launch, Dr. Dooshima Kwange who represented the Honourable Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, commended the various activities that are driven through the One Health approach such as the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (NFELTP), multi-sectoral disease technical working groups and joint investigations of zoonotic diseases and other public health events. She stated that the FMARD and its agencies remain fully committed to ensuring the success of the One Health platform by achieving accelerated growth in livestock products for self-sufficiency. In the same vein, Chika Okpala representing the Honourable Minister of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmoud, committed to continue the strong collaboration with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture for the successful implementation of the One Health strategic plan. In closing, the Director General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) expressed the agency’s commitment to continue serving as a strong secretariat for One Health functions in Nigeria.

Hospital support staff cleaning or disinfecting contaminated surfaces, materials and supplies without adequate protective gear. Laboratory staff handling blood samples of patients without appropriate precautions. Medical or hospital support staff preparing and/or handling dead bodies of Lassa fever patients without appropriate precautions. To reduce the risk of Lassa fever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) offers the following advice to all health care workers: Practice standard precautions at all times while handling patients and body fluids i.e. always perform hand hygiene at the designated five moments, wear the correct PPE based on the procedure to be performed, irrespective of provisional diagnosis of the patient. Appropriately dispose and disinfect items used by Lassa fever patients such as syringes, thermometers, beddings, clothing, cups, plates, spoons, etc. Ensure injectables and sharp items are disposed safely. Clean the hospital environment regularly using appropriate materials and methods. Dispose of all healthcare waste in a safe manner. Maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever i.e. be vigilant and look out for Lassa fever symptoms. Remember, not all fevers are due to malaria. Test all suspected cases of malaria using Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). When the RDT is negative, other causes of febrile illness including Lassa fever should be considered and cases investigated accordingly. Any febrile illness that has not responded to 48 hours use of anti-malaria or antibiotics should raise an index of suspicion for Lassa fever! The national guidelines for Lassa fever case management and Infection prevention and control are available on the NCDC website for download (http://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines). Please report all suspected cases of Lassa fever to your Local Government Area Disease Surveillance and Notification Officer (DSNO). They are the first link to response and care for Lassa fever cases in Nigeria.

As this is a new virus, and new information is emerging every day, this advisory will be updated as new information and research on the virus and its impact on populations become available. The first case of a novel (new) coronavirus strain (2019nCoV) was confirmed in China on the 7th of January, 2020. According to preliminary investigations, most patients either visited or worked in the Huanan Seafood wholesale market, Wuhan city. As at the 20th of January, 2020, 278 laboratory-confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection including six deaths have been reported to WHO globally since the first case was reported on the 31st of December 2019. Many of the initial cases were thought to have contracted the virus through animal-to-human transmission from the market, but human-to-human transmission has also been established. Global surveillance is being established and it is expected that more cases will be reported over the next weeks. Wuhan city is a major transport hub in China. Beyond Wuhan, cases have been confirmed in other cities in China; Guangdong, Beijing and Shanghai. As at the 21st of January, five cases have been confirmed in four other countries: Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United States of America, all with a travel history to China. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are normally transmitted between animals and people. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of the virus that has not been previously identified in humans. Some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household or health care setting. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has convened its Emergency Committee today (22/01/20) to determine whether this outbreak should be declared a “Public Health Event of International Concern” (PHEIC). Symptoms This new coronavirus, 2019nCoV, appears to cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms like cough and breathing difficulties. From current evidence, it appears that death is a rare outcome, and occurs mostly in patients with underlying illness. Treatment There is no specific treatment for disease caused by the novel coronavirus yet. However, many of the symptoms can be treated. Therefore, treatment is based on the patient’s clinical condition. In addition, supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective. Nigeria’s preparedness and response The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is currently coordinating a multisectoral technical group that is assessing and managing the risk of importation to Nigeria. NCDC is in close communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) who is closely monitoring the situation globally. WHO is in direct communication with the Government of China and other affected countries, and has released technical and travel guidance. The Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria has been placed on alert and has heightened screening measures at the points of entry. In China, exit screening measures have been enhanced for travellers from Wuhan city at the Points of Entry (PoE) (airports and ground transport stations) since the 14th of January, 2020. This includes temperature checks combined with provision of information and masks to passengers with fever, as well as directing symptomatic passengers to health facilities for follow up. Nigerians are advised to remain calm. Travelers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets. Travelers from Wuhan to Nigeria, may be asked questions upon arrival by the Port Health Services unit at points of entry about symptoms of illness and travel history, and are advised to report immediately to NCDC if they feel ill after a trip to Wuhan. The Federal Ministry of Health through NCDC and its partners are fully committed to strengthening our preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks. Information will be shared with the public as it becomes available. How to protect yourself To reduce the risk of spread of coronavirus, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following measures: •Wash your hands regularly with soap under running water. •Cover your mouth and nose properly with handkerchief or tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing. You may also cough into your elbow if a handkerchief is not available. •Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. •Avoid self-medication, report to the nearest health facility when you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms. •Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history. As the situation is evolving, this advisory will be updated as more information becomes available.

As this is a new virus, and new information is emerging every day, this advisory will be updated as new information and research on the virus and its impact on populations become available. The Emergency Committee reconvened by the WHO Director-General on the 30th January 2020, declared the novel coronavirus 2019 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This is to halt the spread of the virus outside China, stop person-to-person transmission and provide a global coordinated effort to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support. It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country and preparedness is critical. The Nigerian Government is closely monitoring the ongoing novel coronavirus 2019 outbreak which originated in Wuhan, China. As at 30th January, it has spread to 18 countries (Japan, Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Republic of Singapore, Thailand, United States of America, Australia, Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, French Republic, Malaysia, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Philippines, India and Finland) affecting four continents (Asia, Europe, USA & Australia). So far, there are 7,818 confirmed cases with 170 deaths. Case Fatality Rate is currently 2.2%. Till date, there is no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus on the African continent. Given the present situation, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has put in place quick and diverse strategies to prevent importation of cases into country. A multi sectoral Coronavirus Preparedness Group has been constituted to carry out regular epidemic intelligence gathering, enhanced surveillance at the points of entry, intensive risk communications, strengthen laboratory capacity for testing, placing National First Rapid Response Team to highly pathogenic infections on alert, scaling up of Public Health Emergency Operation Centres in states etc. (PHEOCs already established in 22 states) The Coronavirus Preparedness Group has representatives from Federal Ministry Of Health (FMoH), Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control (US-CDC), Pro-Health International (PHI), Public Health England (PHE) and others working with the NCDC in assessing and managing the risk of importation of the disease to Nigeria, as well as making preparations for early detection and response.

For this novel coronavirus (nCoV), while most initial transmission appeared to be zoonotic, person- to-person transmission has occurred. The Chinese Government has extended the Lunar New Year holiday and put in place other measures to dissuade their citizens from traveling out of China, as part of many significant measures to contain the spread of the virus outside China. There are major travel restrictions in the main affected areas in China and air passengers traveling from Wuhan, China are screened on exit to prevent the exportation of the virus. This includes temperature checks combined with the provision of information and masks to passengers. Passengers without symptoms on departure, but become unwell in transit are encouraged to self-report to the relevant authorities on arrival. The Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health has heightened screening measures at points of entry. In addition to automated thermal screening at points of entry, travellers from China to Nigeria, are asked questions upon arrival by the Port Health Services unit about symptoms of illness and travel history and are advised to contact NCDC if they feel unwell after a trip to Wuhan. Nigerians are advised to remain calm. Travellers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead) and animal markets. Symptoms This new coronavirus appears to cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms like cough, fever and breathing difficulties. From current evidence about 98 persons out of 100 persons with the disease recover, and it appears that death is a rare outcome, mostly in patients with underlying health issues.

As at the 24th of January 2020, 195 confirmed cases and 29 deaths had been reported in 11 states. Of the confirmed cases, 89% are from Ondo, Edo and Ebonyi States. The increase in the number of cases at this time of the year is not unusual due to ecological factors. The National EOC includes representatives from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, World Health Organization, UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control, and other partners. The NCDC continues to support states in strengthening their preparedness and response capacity. Over the last three weeks, NCDC has deployed Rapid Response Teams to support five of the affected states. The Honourable Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire led a high-level delegation to Kano State on the 25th of January 2020, following the deaths of two health workers infected with Lassa fever. In addition, NCDC has rapidly increased risk communications and community engagement activities to ensure that Nigerians are aware of the risks of Lassa fever and measures to protect themselves. There has been a decline in the case fatality rate of reported Lassa fever cases from 23.4% in 2019 to 14.8% this year. NCDC continues to support treatment centres across states in the country to effectively manage Lassa fever cases. In addition, five laboratories in Nigeria have the capacity to diagnose Lassa fever in Nigeria. These laboratories are critical to reducing turnaround time between identifying a suspected case and confirmation. This ensures prompt case management and other response activities, thereby reducing the number of deaths. Nigeria is contributing to research and other activities for the development of a Lassa fever vaccine. NCDC and the three main treatment centres in the country- Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Federal Medical Centre Owo and Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital Abakalilki- are set to commence Lassa fever epidemiological studies that will provide data to guide research and response activities. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control remains committed to protecting the health of Nigerians. It is important for members of the public to practice good hygiene and take measures to protect themselves and their families. WHAT IS LASSA FEVER? Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and cases are recorded all year round. The Lassa fever virus is transmitted by rodents which can be found in our environment. This contributes largely to the risk of spread that occurs in Nigeria and other countries with similar ecological factors. Lassa fever is largely transmitted through contact with items or surfaces contaminated with urine, faeces, saliva or blood of infected rats. It can also be transmitted from person-to-person through contact with blood, urine, faeces and other body fluids of an infected person. To minimise the risk of infection, members of the public are advised to ensure their environment is always kept clean to avoid contact with rodents. Health care workers should maintain a high index of suspicion as Lassa fever can present with fever just like malaria and other illnesses. It is very important that health care workers maintain standard care precautions when managing patients. Early symptoms are fever, headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, sore throat etc. It is in very severe cases that the patient bleeds from body openings. If a patient does not respond to treatment for malaria or other febrile illnesses after 48 hours, it is important to test immediately for Lassa fever. ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in the year 2011 in response to the challenges of public health emergencies and to enhance Nigeria’s preparedness and response to epidemics through prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases. Its core mandate is to detect, investigate, prevent and control diseases of national and international public health importance.

On 30th January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and urged Member Countries to strengthen preparedness for prevention and response to COVID-19. One of the most important areas to prepare for is to prevent transmission in health care settings, through appropriate infection prevention and control. In response to the potential spread of the outbreak to African Union Member States (MS), the Africa CDC activated its Emergency Operations Centre on 27 January 2020. On 3 February 2020, the Director General of the Africa CDC inaugurated a task force during a meeting with representatives of National Public Health Institutes in Africa to support pan-African coordination of coronavirus prevention, detection and response. The task force consists of five working groups: surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, risk communication and community engagement, infection prevention and control as well as clinical management of COVID-19 infection. Nigeria through her National Public Health Institute, NCDC was identified to lead the IPC working group tasked with strengthening IPC capacity across Africa. Infection prevention and control measures cuts across all other working groups and is critical for strengthening preparedness and response activities for COVID-19. NCDC and Africa CDC in collaboration with WHO and ICAN will train representatives from across Africa on IPC for COVID-19. The training meeting is scheduled to take place from 21 – 25 February 2020 in Abuja. It will provide participants with improved capacity for the prevention and/or control of COVID-19, continuous learning opportunities and inclusion into the COVID-19 IPC focal persons’ network for the African region. This experience will also create advocacy for improved commitment to infection prevention and control principles in African Union Member States. The Federal Ministry of Health through NCDC and its partners remains fully committed to strengthening preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks.

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This is an updated advisory on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), following confirmation of the first case in Nigeria on the 27th of February 2020. This advisory will be updated frequently to reflect new information and research emerging on the disease and its impact on populations. On the 28th of February, 2020, the Federal Ministry of Health announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The index case is an Italian businessman who arrived Nigeria from Milan, Italy on the 25th of February, 2020. The case was confirmed at the Virology Laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital on the 27th of February 2020. This laboratory is part of the network of laboratories supported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Prior to laboratory confirmation, the patient had travelled to Ogun State for a business meeting. The index case is clinically stable, with mild symptoms, and is being managed at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba, Lagos. The Federal Ministry of Health through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has activated a national Emergency Operations Centre at the highest level and is leading the national response. A National Rapid Response Team has been deployed to support Lagos and Ogun State Governments with contact tracing and required response activities. Currently, there are four laboratories in NCDC’s molecular laboratory network, with the capacity to test for COVID-19 in Nigeria. These laboratories are sufficiently equipped with reagents and supplies for testing. NCDC is in contact with all states to increase the index of suspicion to ensure cases are detected early. The Federal Ministry of Health has also intensified surveillance at points of entry (Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt and FCT) particularly for returning travelers with travel history to countries with ongoing transmission*. Presently, WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. An intensive communications campaign has begun to provide regular updates and accurate information to Nigerians on protecting themselves.  HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF To reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following measures: •Wash your hands frequently with soap under running water or use alcohol-based sanitizer if water is not available. •Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing. Dispose of the tissue properly immediately after use. You may also cough into your elbow if a tissue is not available. •Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. •Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history. TRAVEL ADVICE Exit and entry screening has been intensified across several countries, particularly countries with ongoing local transmission. This includes temperature checks and provision of accurate information on preventive measures at airports. In Nigeria, the Port Health Services of the Federal Ministry of Health has heightened screening measures at points of entry. In addition to automated temperature screening at points of entry, travelers are given a contact form to fill and asked questions upon arrival about symptoms of illness and travel history. Travelers to Nigeria · Travelers without symptoms on departure but become unwell in transit are advised to self-report to the Port Health Services on arrival · Travelers from countries with ongoing local transmission*, but who show no symptoms on arrival should self-isolate at home for 14 days after arrival · If travelers from countries with ongoing local transmission* feel ill with fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days of arrival in Nigeria, please: o Observe self-isolation immediately by staying indoors and avoiding contact with people o Call the NCDC 24/7 toll-free line IMMEDIATELY on 080097000010 o Avoid self-medication Travelers to China and other affected countries •We strongly advise that all non-essential travel to countries with ongoing local transmission* should be postponed, until the outbreak is contained •Travelers from Nigeria to China and other affected countries are advised to avoid contact with sick people. ADVICE FOR HEALTH WORKERS All health workers are advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19. Health officials are advised to call 07032864444 for sample transportation and related advice if you have a case that fits the national case definition. ADVICE FOR SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES The current situation in the country does not warrant a shutdown of daily activities. If there is sustained community transmission in Nigeria, various additional measures may be instituted. For now; •Schools are advised to circulate NCDC’s public health advisory and related materials on COVID-19 to all staff, students and parents •Businesses are advised to circulate NCDC’s public health advisory and related materials on COVID-19 to all employees, clients and visitors •Encourage sick employees and students to stay at home if they are unwell. •Ensure routine cleaning of high contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones etc. •Provide facilities and emphasise the importance of hand washing *Countries with ongoing transmission as at February 28, 2020: China, Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan ABOUT CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) COVID-19 appears to cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. From current evidence about 98 persons out of 100 persons with the disease will recover. In about 10- 15% of cases, it will cause a severe illness. It appears that death is not a common outcome and occurs mostly in elderly patients with underlying health issues. Currently, four laboratories in Nigeria can diagnose COVID-19. In addition to the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, this includes the Virology Laboratory of Lagos University Teaching Hospital; Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital and African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in Ede, Osun State. There is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated. Therefore, treatment is based on the patient’s clinical condition. Supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/238/update-on-covid-19-in-nigeria", "title": "UPDATE ON COVID-19 IN NIGERIA", "body": "Two new developments have taken place since the last briefing in Abuja on the coronavirus situation in Nigeria. The first is that a team of researchers from various institutions in Nigeria, including scientists from the Centre for Human and Zoology Virology in LUTH, African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in Redeemers University and the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) Lagos, combined their efforts to successfully perform the genome sequencing of the coronavirus strain that the index case brought to Nigeria and proved it to be a match with the virus circulating in Italy and Wuhan. This was coordinated by the Lagos State Ministry of Health and NCDC. It is the first time the sequencing of this virus has been performed in Africa. The result has been shared with International Authorities and the Director General of the World Health Organization has extended congratulations to Nigerian scientists for this achievement. The other development is that contact tracing and monitoring in respect of the coronavirus index case presently receiving treatment in Lagos, has been diligently and conscientiously pursued since 27 February when the case was first diagnosed. A total of 217 contacts were linked to the index case. Of the 217, 45 traveled out of Nigeria and 172 are presently in Nigeria. Of the 172 contacts currently in Nigeria, 69 are in Lagos, 40 in Ogun and 52 in other States, with 11 in unknown locations. Nevertheless, the Federal Ministry of Health, following best practice, decided to test these persons for the possible presence of coronavirus in their systems. On 8th March 2020, scientists confirmed the presence of coronavirus in one of the contacts. It is my duty, therefore, to announce a new case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Nigeria The newly confirmed case is an Ogun State contact of the index case, but he has no significant clinical symptoms. This brings the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria today to two. Since the beginning of the outbreak in China and subsequent spread to other countries, one of the important response strategies at the containment stage, has been to identify all contacts, ensure their strict isolation and to follow up daily with checks for any symptoms of the disease. Following recent experience from other countries and evidence from newly published studies on non-symptomatic infections, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control NCDC, advised that samples should be taken from all contacts of the Index case for testing. It is in this process that this new case was detected. I repeat that the newly confirmed case in Nigeria is not a new importation, but a contact of the Index case, who has since been in isolation and was under clinical follow up. He presently does not have any clinical symptoms, is comfortable and in care at Infectious Disease Hospital, Lagos. Recent studies in China have shown that increased surveillance, contact tracing and isolation reduces the risk of spread, because further opportunities for transmission of the virus by the infected patient in the community are limited. All other contacts of the index case in Ogun and Lagos will remain in isolation and testing will be carried out on those not yet tested, including some in other states. On the case reported in the US of Nigerian origin, we are in touch with colleagues at the US Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and here in Abuja. The case visited Lagos in February 2020. However, given the timelines between the time he was in Nigeria briefly and when he became ill, the likelihood that he was infected in Lagos is very low. The Federal Ministry of Heath, and Lagos and Ogun States Health Ministries assure citizens of our commitment to do all needed to control spread of this outbreak. Since the first case was confirmed in Nigeria on 27th of February 2020, the National Emergency Operations Centres (EOC) in Abuja, continues to work closely with Lagos and Ogun State EOCs to coordinate response activities. I again strongly advise against spreading misinformation to cause fear and panic. The Federal Ministry of Health and NCDC will continue to provide prompt and reliable updates and initiate all measures required to protect our people. A globally emerging lesson here is that some people who contracted COVID-19 appear to experience zero or only mild illness and will recover; however, other patients develop more severe symptoms, especially if they have other underlying illnesses, or are weakened by old age. I urge Nigerians to take care of their health and protect others by continuing to do the following: •Regularly and thoroughly wash hands with soap & water for at least 30 seconds, if not possible use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. •Maintain at least 2 metres (5 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing repeatedly. •Be sure you and people around you follow good respiratory hygiene, meaning, to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief if coughing or sneezing and disposing of used tissue immediately. Alternatively, use your bent elbow when you cough or sneeze, when no tissue is available. •Do not mingle with people or congregate, but instead stay at home if you feel unwell with symptoms like fever, cough, sneezing, or difficulty in breathing. •Please call NCDC toll-free number which is available 24/7 for guidance- 080097000010. •Do not engage in lengthy self-medication Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19 through official channels including Lagos State Ministry of Health, Ogun State Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Federal Ministry of Health.

This online course is available to the general public but targeted at health care workers, to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases while administering health care in Nigeria. As at 03 July 2020, a total of 27,564 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 628 deaths have been recorded by NCDC. Additionally, as at 02 June 2020, about 812 health care workers have been infected in-country with over 230,000 infected globally. The national strategy in response to COVID-19 has been multifaceted. In the absence of a vaccine or cure, compliance with IPC measures remains one of the most effective interventions to control the ongoing outbreak. The NCDC has made efforts to rapidly strengthen the capacity of frontline healthcare workers in infection prevention and control wherever health care is provided. Since the first case in Nigeria was confirmed in February, NCDC has supported the training of about 17,436 health workers in IPC and works in collaboration with the Departments of Hospital Services and Food and Drugs of the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), to ensure that health workers are provided with the required personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of health workers’ infection. To ensure that IPC training, knowledge and information is easily accessible to all who need it, the Infection Prevention and Control Unit of the NCDC, with technical assistance from eHealth Africa, has developed a COVID-19 IPC online course. The course features modules on standard and transmission-based precautions, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other essential aspects of infection control in healthcare. A certificate of participation will also be awarded at the end of the course by NCDC.

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This is an updated advisory on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This advisory will be updated frequently to reflect new information and research emerging on the disease and its impact on populations. The Federal Ministry of Health, through the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), has activated a national Emergency Operations Centre at the highest level and is leading the national response. A National Rapid Response Team has been deployed to support affected State Governments with response activities. Currently, there are five laboratories in NCDC’s molecular laboratory network with the capacity to test for COVID-19 in Nigeria. These laboratories are sufficiently equipped with reagents and supplies for testing. The Federal Government of Nigeria has restricted entry into Nigeria for travellers from the following high incidence countries; China, Italy, Iran, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, United States of America, United Kingdom, Netherlands & Switzerland. ‬Effective from Saturday, 21st of March 2020 for an initial period of four weeks. These are countries with over 1,000 cases domestically. The Federal Government has also suspended the issuance of visa on arrival to travellers from these countries with immediate effect. An intensive communications campaign has begun to provide regular updates and accurate information to Nigerians on protecting themselves. This can be found on www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng TRAVEL ADVICE Nigerians are strongly advised against non-essential travel to high incidence countries i.e. countries with over 1,000 cases domestically. All returning travellers from foreign countries are required to self-isolate for 14-days. The NCDC has disseminated information on the practice of self-isolation. Additionally, travellers returning from high risk countries will be actively followed-up for 14 days by the NCDC and Port Health Services. The Port Health Services of the Federal Ministry of Health has heightened screening measures at points of entry (Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt and FCT). In addition to automated temperature screening at points of entry, travellers are given a contact form to fill and asked questions upon arrival about symptoms of illness and travel history. The NCDC is also working with the Nigerian Customs Services to enhance surveillance at land borders to prevent further importation of the disease. TRAVELLERS TO NIGERIA •Travellers without symptoms on departure who become unwell in transit should self-report immediately to the Port Health Services on arrival •Travel restrictions have been imposed on travellers to Nigeria from China, Italy, Iran, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, United States of America, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Switzerland •All travellers returning to Nigeria from any country must self-isolate for 14 days, whether symptomatic or not.

ADVICE FOR HEALTH WORKERS Healthcare workers are always advised to observe standard infection prevention and control measures when attending to patients and take a travel history. All health workers are strongly advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19. Health officials are advised to call 07032864444 for sample transportation and related advice if you have a case that fits the national case definition. ADVICE FOR SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES The current situation in the country does not warrant a shutdown of daily activities. The NCDC has published and disseminated guidelines for safe gatherings on how to ensure preventive measures during gatherings. If there is sustained community transmission in Nigeria, various additional measures may be instituted. For now: •Schools are advised to circulate NCDC’s public health advisory and related materials on COVID-19 to all staff, students and parents. •Businesses are advised to circulate NCDC’s public health advisory and related materials on COVID-19 to all employees, clients and visitors. •Provide facilities for hand washing and emphasise the importance of this. •Encourage sick employees and students to stay at home. •Ensure routine cleaning of high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones etc. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF To reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following measures: 1.Wash your hands frequently with soap under running water for at least 30 seconds or use alcohol-based sanitiser if water is not available. 2.Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness. Maintain at least 2 metres (5 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing repeatedly 3.Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing. Dispose of the tissue properly immediately after use. You may also cough into your elbow if a tissue is not available. 4.Do not mingle with people or congregate if you feel unwell with symptoms like fever, cough, sneezing or difficulty breathing. ABOUT CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) COVID-19 appears to cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms like fever, cough and difficulty breathing. From current evidence, about 98 persons out of 100 persons with the disease will recover. In about 10- 15% of cases, it will cause a severe illness. It appears that death is not a common outcome and occurs mostly in elderly patients with underlying health issues. There is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated. Treatment is based on the patient’s clinical condition but supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective. ABOUT NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is the government agency with the mandate to lead the prevention, detection, and control of communicable diseases. Its functions are to prevent, detect, investigate and control communicable diseases of national and international public health importance.

This is following successive decline in cases below the emergency threshold, and an epidemiological review carried out by NCDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO). On the 24th of January 2020, NCDC declared a Lassa fever outbreak and activated a national Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). This was in response to an increase in Lassa fever cases at the beginning of the year, exceeding the threshold for an outbreak. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 979 confirmed cases including 188 deaths have been recorded from 27 States including the Federal Capital Territory as at 19th of April 2020. The Lassa fever case count has significantly declined in the last three weeks and has now dropped below levels considered to be a national emergency. In the last four months, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Environment and Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Response have led Lassa fever response activities across the country. This was done in close collaboration with State Ministries of Health, and with support from partners coordinated by WHO. Following lessons from the previous large outbreaks, our strategic response was based on five key priorities: 1.Improved preparedness through training of health workers across the country and a nationwide communications campaign before the outbreak 2.Early deployment of One-Health Rapid Response Teams to affected States and deployment of surge staff to treatment centres 3. Establishment of new treatment centres and strengthening of existing treatment centres 4.Distribution of medical, laboratory, treatment and infection prevention and control supplies to all states with confirmed cases 5.Implementation of Lassa fever Environmental response campaign in high burden states by the Federal Ministry of Environment It is important to highlight that this year, there was a decline in case fatality of Lassa fever, from 23% in 2019 to 19% in 2020. The NCDC also supported peer to peer training by creating exchange programmes between states, treatment centres and laboratories. Importantly, the NCDC and the major treatment centres at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki and Federal Medical Centre Owo, have begun the process for a large epidemiological study in collaboration with WHO and CEPI. This epidemiological study being implemented in Nigeria and other West African countries, is expected to contribute to Lassa fever vaccine development. Despite the end of the emergency phase of this outbreak, the NCDC will continue to coordinate the national multisectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group (TWG). This TWG ensures continuous monitoring of cases, as well as strengthening of Lassa fever surveillance, diagnostic, treatment and other response activities across all levels in Nigeria. The NCDC recognises that in the absence of a vaccine, Nigeria remains at risk of Lassa fever cases. In the last two years, Nigeria has recorded Lassa fever cases throughout the year, with the peak usually between January and April. According to the Director General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, “Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we remain focused on our prevention, detection and response to other infectious disease outbreaks in Nigeria, including Lassa fever. While we have crossed the emergency phase, we know that we will continue to record cases. The NCDC remains committed to ensuring a continuous decline in the number of people who die from Lassa fever, by early detection and appropriate treatment”. The NCDC is also working with States and partners to establish more long-term strategies such as improved communication, regular environmental sanitation, enhanced capacity of health workers and improvement of diagnostic and treatment centres among others. The NCDC remains very grateful to all its partners including WHO, Africa Centres for Disease Control, West African Health Organisation, US Centers for Disease Control, World Bank, George Town University, UNICEF, Africa Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), Public Health England, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Resolve to Save Lives, International Federation of Red cross Communities, Alliance for Medical Action (ALIMA), Pro Health International, Medecins Sans Frontiers, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations(CEPI), eHealth Africa, ECHO, Japanese Government, Robert Koch Institute and Bernard Nocht Institute in Germany, PANDORA, and other organisations. We’re extremely grateful to all frontline health workers for their hard work and dedication during this outbreak. We advise healthcare workers to continue to practice standard precautions at all times: i.e. wear personal protective equipment such gloves when providing care to an ill patient/relative, as any febrile illness can be Lassa fever. Our message to Nigerians is to practice good personal hygiene i.e. always wash your hands with soap and water, keep your environment clean and rodent free to prevent the spread of Lassa fever.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/253/100-days-of-nigeria-covid-19-response", "title": "100 Days of Nigeria COVID-19 Response", "body": "06 June 2020 | Abuja – 100 DAYS OF NIGERIA’S COVID-19 RESPONSE On the 27th of February 2020, Nigeria confirmed its first case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). One hundred days after, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported 11,844 confirmed cases and 333 deaths. Additionally, 3,696 people have been treated and discharged successfully. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries across the world. Over 6 million people have been affected, and the number of deaths has exceeded 300,000 as at the 6th of June 2020. As Nigeria’s Public Health Institute, NCDC continues to work alongside other agencies under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Health, in leading the public health response to the outbreak. In addition, the agency has played a key role in the multi-sectoral response, within the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF-COVID-19), established by President Muhammadu Buhari. One hundred days after the first case, we remember all Nigerians who have passed away from the disease. We commiserate with their families and friends who have had to deal with the difficulty of losing loved ones at this time. To ensure a well-coordinated emergency response, NCDC activated a Level 3 Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on the 27th of February 2020. Prior to this, the National EOC was in alert mode; monitoring the spread in other countries, carrying out risk assessments and strengthening Nigeria’s preparedness. During this time, NCDC developed technical guidelines, response plans and trained health workers across the country. The National EOC includes representatives from the Federal Ministry of Health, other sister agencies and partners. Prior to the confirmation of the first case, NCDC supported four laboratories within its molecular laboratory network to activate testing for COVID-19. Since then, the number of laboratories has increased to 30, with a combined minimum capacity of 10,000 tests daily. The goal is to expand to at least 10 more laboratories by the end of June, leveraging on Gene-Xpert capacity for Tuberculosis diagnosis. The safety of health workers has been at the forefront of Nigeria’s response strategy to COVID-19. Since the first case was confirmed, NCDC has supported the training of 13,000 health workers in infection prevention and control (IPC) as well as case management. In collaboration with the Departments of Hospital Services and Food and Drugs of the Federal Ministry of Health, NCDC has also ensured that health workers are provided with the required personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of health workers’ infection. As part of its mandate, NCDC has provided support to all states in Nigeria. Over the last three years, in preparedness for major outbreaks, the agency supported the establishment of State Public Health Emergency Operations Centres in 23 of the 30 states in Nigeria, without polio or public health EOCs. These EOCs have served as the coordination hub at state level since the first case was confirmed in Nigeria. The NCDC has deployed its highest number of rapid response teams - with 37 teams across 34 states and the FCT. The extent of this response has been supported by the deployment of additional surge teams from the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (NFELTP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC). NCDC continues to support every State with medical supplies, transportation of samples, training of health workers, risk communications and other response activities. The NCDC launched the #TakeResponsibility campaign which has formed the cornerstone of public health messaging. This is done by leveraging on social media, mainstream media and other avenues to encourage Nigerians to take responsibility for protecting themselves and loved ones and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Over 150 jingles currently air on radio and television, reaching communities across the country. With the support of Nigeria’s telecommunication companies, over 100 million text messages have been sent out since February 2020 reminding Nigerians about measures that can be taken to protect themselves from COVID-19. The NCDC continues to work closely with the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, as well as the National Orientation Agency to educate Nigerians on how to protect themselves. A key strength of Nigeria’s response has been the strong collaboration among Federal Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, as well as with partners. As part of the global and regional response, NCDC has received guidance and support from WHO, Africa Centres for Disease Control and the West African Health Organisation. The response to the pandemic has not been without challenges – global competition for access to reagents and medical supplies limited the initial testing capacity of the molecular laboratories. Today, the Presidential Task Force paid a visit to the National Reference Laboratory in Gaduwa, Abuja, in recognition of the role the apex laboratory is playing in response to the pandemic. Strengthening laboratory capacity nationwide and increasing access to testing is a major priority for Nigeria’s response, in the coming months. The NCDC continues to work with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Medical Laboratory and Science Council of Nigeria and other partners to carry out laboratory related research and validation, as Nigeria scales up its testing capacity. Since the first confirmed case was reported one hundred days ago, several health workers have been at the forefront. We remain grateful to State Task Forces, Emergency Operations Centres, Rapid Response Teams, laboratory scientists and all health workers who continue to work very hard for national health security. The NCDC remains committed to working under the supervision of our parent Ministry, the Federal Ministry of Health, and in collaboration with other Ministries, Departments and Agencies through the PTF, to scale up Nigeria’s response. Our strategy is to ensure more people are tested, contacts are traced early to prevent further spread and confirmed cases are treated. In the absence of a vaccine, Nigeria and the rest of the world must depend on public health, social measures and supportive management of confirmed cases. We urge all Nigerians to take individual and collective responsibility by adhering to public health advice such as; •Frequent hand hygiene through hand washing or use of alcohol-based sanitiser. •Use of face mask in public places •Observing physical distancing of at least two metres About the NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is the country’s national public health institute, with the mandate to lead the preparedness, detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies.

Following the review of recent restriction measures by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, NCDC has developed new guidelines for places of worship in Nigeria. This is to ensure safe gatherings and prevent exposures to COVID-19 infection in religious settings. On the 2nd of June 2020, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 announced the relaxation of the previous ban placed on religious settings, allowing faith groups to meet while adhering to public health and social measures. In several countries, COVID-19 outbreaks have been linked to large gatherings, including religious and non-religious gatherings. To reduce the risk of infection in places of worship, NCDC offers the following guidance: • There should be no entry without facemasks. All attendees and religious leaders must wear a face mask • People who are sick should not go to places of worship. There should be temperature screening on entry • Hand washing facilities and hand sanitizers should be provided at point of entries and strategic points • Attendance at religious settings should not exceed 1/3 of sitting capacity • Religious centres should be clearly marked such that people sit and maintain two metres distance from each other • There should be no form of direct contact. Practices such as handshakes as peace signs are discouraged • Practices that require sharing of materials should be limited. For example, ablution should be performed at home • Religious centres should be disinfected routinely, before and after worship The guidelines developed by NCDC provides additional requirements to ensure that places of worship are safe.

Given our mandate to protect the health of all Nigerians, we are obliged to state the facts. The NCDC is leading the expansion of testing capacity for COVID-19 in Nigeria. As part of the national strategy to scale up COVID-19 testing published in March 2020, we are leveraging GeneXpert equipment currently used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The use of GeneXpert will significantly scale-up testing for COVID-19 and improve turn-around time for results in the country. Nigeria is one of many countries around the world using the GeneXpert system to scale up testing capacity. This expansion process is in collaboration with the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP), and supported by partners at US-CDC, KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, Institute of Human Virology Nigeria (IHVN) and others. There are 400 sites in Nigeria with GeneXpert equipment for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, we have prioritised the roll-out of GeneXpert in states where there is a high level of community transmission and states with limited or no laboratory capacity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at the moment. These are Abia, Adamawa, Benue, Borno, Cross River, Lagos, Enugu, Kaduna, Kogi, Nasarawa, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Benue, and the FCT. Already, we have worked with NTBLCP and our partners to activate two GeneXpert laboratories in Kaduna and Nasarawa States. Eventually, we plan to roll out the GeneXpert testing sites for COVID-19 in every state in Nigeria. The statements by the Cross River Commissioners of Information and Health are a misinterpretation of the Federal Ministry of Health's COVID-19 testing strategy and efforts to protect the health of Nigerians from this disease. We would like to state unequivocally, that there is no plan to transport positive samples from one state to the other. One of our responsibilities at NCDC is to scale-up the capacity for COVID-19 diagnosis in Nigeria as we respond to this pandemic. Our ability to promptly detect cases and halt the spread of the virus in our communities, is largely dependent on our ability to scale-up access to testing for Nigerians. We remain strongly committed to our mandate to protect the health of Nigerians. We urge the public to remain aware of the risks of COVID-19 and to adhere to the preventive measures advised by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Federal Ministry of Health.

This is especially important where there is ongoing widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as in public transport, markets, and confined or crowded environments. In Nigeria, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 mandated the use of face masks or coverings in public spaces, on the 27th of April 2020. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) published advisories on the use of face masks and guidance on making cloth masks.  The use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention is important, as recent studies indicate that a significant proportion of people who have COVID-19 do not show symptoms (asymptomatic), and the virus can spread before these people know that they are sick (presymptomatic). SARS-CoV-2 which causes the coronavirus disease, can spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, often through speaking, coughing or sneezing. There is evidence that the correct use of face masks reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection.  An increasing number of people in Nigeria are now using face shields, in the place of face masks, as they become more widely available. Face shields are generally used in health care settings by medical professionals to provide barrier protection to the facial area, including the eyes, nose and lips. Even in healthcare settings, face shields are not meant to function as primary respiratory protection to prevent infection. Face shields are used in combination with surgical mask or N95 mask by health workers for maximum protection during invasive procedures such as intubation.  There are no published studies on the effectiveness of face shields against COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings.  The NCDC offers the following guidance to Nigerians on the appropriate use of face masks and face shields:  1.Face masks are very important in helping to limit the spread of COVID-19, especially in situations where physical distancing may be difficult, such as on public transportation, markets and in areas where there is a significant amount of community transmission. 2.For effective protection, face shields are used in combination with an appropriate face mask in healthcare settings. 3.There is currently limited to no evidence on the effectiveness of face shields to prevent COVID-19 when used alone by the general public in non-healthcare settings. 4.There is currently no guidance provided by the WHO or other relevant public health authority that recommends the use of face shields in non-healthcare settings to prevent COVID-19.  Given the limited evidence on the effectiveness of face shields in protecting people from COVID-19 infection in community settings, and the absence of recommendations on their use, by the WHO and other public health authorities, face shields alone should not be used in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 infection. When used, it should be done in combination with an appropriate face mask.  It is important to remember that currently, no single intervention even when properly used, provides complete protection from COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the use of face masks or face shields with face masks should be combined with other public health and social measures as announced by the Federal/State Ministries of Health and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. This includes maintaining a distance of two metres between you and the next person, frequent handwashing with soap and running water or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and avoiding public gatherings.  The NCDC will continue to update its recommendations as knowledge about COVID-19 evolves.

World Mask Week (WMW) aims to reinforce the importance of wearing a face mask to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the absence of a vaccine that can prevent infection, and as COVID-19 cases increase globally, citizens must depend on non-pharmaceutical measures, which include the use of face masks, hand washing, physical distancing and supportive management of confirmed cases to mitigate the impact of the disease. World Mask Week, an initiative from a coalition of organisations including the Pandemic Action Network (PAN), World Health Organisation (WHO), Africa CDC and private companies working to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 globally, will run from August 7th -14th 2020. In Nigeria, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Federal Ministry of Health, NCDC and partner organisations will run activities for WMW which includes awareness campaigns in communities and media features nationwide to sensitise Nigerians on the importance of wearing face masks to slow down the spread of COVID-19. The campaign on social media will also feature the hashtags #MaskOnNaija, #MaskingForAFriend and #TakeResponsibility. Studies have shown that the correct use of face masks is critical in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the World Mask Week movement encourages people and businesses around the world to rally behind the importance of wearing a mask properly, not only during WMW, but everyday until a vaccine that prevents infection is readily accessible to all citizens. The use of masks is a key component of Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) procedures in medical and non-medical settings. Given the widespread community transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria, strict adherence to the use of masks in public spaces particularly, where physical distancing may not be practical, can help slow the spread of the virus. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director-General of the NCDC, added that only strong partnerships can fight the pandemic. “World Mask Week is a timely campaign that shows what can be achieved when government, private sector and individuals come together to push a simple yet important action. By reinforcing the need to wear a face mask, we are prioritising IPC on the global agenda and demonstrating the role that everyone has to play, protecting each other, saving lives and slowing the spread of COVID-19 globally.” “We are glad to join this global campaign to educate Nigerians on the importance of wearing a face mask” said Dr E. Osagie Ehanire, Honourable Minister of Health. “The appropriate use of a face mask, is one of the comprehensive non-pharmaceutical preventive and control measures adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 by preventing respiratory droplet transmission. Masks can also be used by healthy persons to reduce exposure”. The NCDC, as part of efforts to strengthen IPC in health facilities, continues to prioritise the training of health workers as well as the timely supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) - including face masks - to state facilities. As Nigeria’s public health institute, we will continue to provide periodic advisories on face mask usage – including the making and care of reusable cloth masks.

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This is an updated advisory on COVID-19 which will be updated frequently to reflect new information and research emerging on the disease and its impact on populations. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) through the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has continued to lead the national public health response in Nigeria with oversight of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF-COVID-19). The NCDC is also working closely with all states of the Federation to support their response activities to the pandemic. Several measures have been instituted by the Federal Government of Nigeria through the PTF-COVID-19 together with the Federal Ministry of Health to curtail the spread of the disease and protect the health of Nigerians. This includes an initial lockdown of non-essential activities; closure of schools; a ban on international flights etc. Nigeria is one of many countries that have commenced the gradual easing of lockdown measures initially instituted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is to ensure a balance between preserving lives and livelihoods while addressing the socio-economic disruptions caused by the outbreak. On the 3rd of September 2020, the PTF-COVID-19 announced the commencement of Phase 3 of the Eased Lockdown effective from the 4th of September 2020 with some significant changes to address economic, sociopolitical and health concerns. The third phase of the lockdown is characterised by the following: Adjusting the current nationwide curfew to now start from 12am to 4am Restrictions on mass gatherings outside the workplace remain with allowance for gatherings of no more than 50 persons in enclosed spaces (weddings, funerals, etc), provided physical distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are enforced Re-opening of the international air space from the 5th of September within established parameters Risk assessment of the level of preparedness of schools with States to commence plans for phased re-opening of educational institutions Limit government meetings to virtual as much as possible while maintaining restrictions on official trips, oversight visits and board meetings until further notice Relaxation on outdoor communal sports and re-opening of recreational parks, event centres and restaurants for outdoor service only. Gyms and cinemas can open to the public at half-capacity, but bars and night clubs shall remain closed until further notice Mandatory use of facemasks in public spaces. Access to government and commercial premises to be denied for persons not wearing facemasks- ‘No mask, no entry. No mask, no service’ Elections to proceed in line with strict guidance on conducting safe elections during the COVID-19 pandemic. ‘No Mask, No Voting’ policy to be enforced. The NCDC continues to expand laboratories for the testing of COVID-19 and has commenced the use of GeneXpert across the country to scale-up testing. The current list of laboratories for the testing of COVID-19 in Nigeria can be here. Through the #TakeResponsibility campaign by the NCDC, Nigerians and residents in the country are urged to take greater individual and collective responsibility in preventing and controlling the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. All resources, guidelines and real-time updates on COVID-19 in Nigeria can be found on https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/. TRAVEL ADVICE While the ban on domestic and international flights have been lifted, operations have commenced with safety advisories in place. The NCDC continues to work with the Port Health Services, Nigeria Customs Service and Nigeria Immigration Service to ensure enhanced surveillance at all points of entry. TRAVELLERS TO NIGERIA The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has release a provisional quarantine protocol for all return travelers to Nigeria, effective from the 5th of September, as detailed below; Passengers must test negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from country of exit 96 hours before departure and preferably within 72 hours pre-boarding. Tests done more than 96 hours before departure are not valid Prior to boarding, passengers are requested to upload their COVID-19 PCR NEGATIVE results on to the national payment portal and have an electronic or hard copy for presentation at the airport All intending passengers are required to register via – http://nitp.ncdc.gov.ng and pay for a repeat (second) PCR test to be done upon arrival in Nigeria Passengers must fill in an online Health Declaration/Self-Reporting Form located on the Nigeria International Travel Portal which must be submitted online or printed for presentation on arrival. Information provided must be verifiable At the time of boarding, all travelers will undergo temperature screening and questioned for COVID-19 symptoms. Passengers with COVID-19 related signs and symptoms will not be allowed to board the flight ON ARRIVAL IN NIGERIA Return passengers must show evidence of payment/appointment for a repeat PCR test, in-country Passengers will be cleared through the Nigeria Immigration System’s Migrants Identification Data Analysis System (MIDAS). Passenger’s biodata page and picture will be forwarded to all COVID-19 PCR Sample Collection Centers to enable proper identification before sample collection Return passengers must proceed on a 7-day self-isolation as per protocol and present at the designated sample collection sites on the 7th day of arrival. Positive cases will be managed based on National Guidelines for COVID-19 treatment. Passengers who test negative after 7 days will end self- isolation on the 8th day ADVICE FOR HEALTH WORKERS All health workers are strongly advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 when attending to patients and take detailed information. The NCDC has published several guidelines including infection prevention control and case management of COVID-19. These can be accessed via https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/guideline/ ADVICE FOR BUSINESSES The NCDC has published a guideline for employers and businesses in Nigeria. Businesses are advised to amplify the #TakeResponsibility campaign and ensure compliance to NPIs within the business environment. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF If you are showing known COVID-19 symptoms such as such as cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing etc., you must immediately call your state helpline. They have the most up to date and state-specific information on COVID-I9 including sample collection sites. Vulnerable groups i.e. people over the age of 60 and/or people with pre-existing medical conditions should avoid non-essential outings and visitors. Where possible, have a friend or family member bring you supplies. This is critical as if infected with the virus, vulnerable persons may have severe complications that could be fatal. See NCDC advisory for vulnerable groups here. To reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19, members of the public are advised to adhere to the following measures: Wear a face mask/covering when out in public Wash your hands frequently with soap under running water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based sanitiser if water is not available Maintain a physical distance of at least 2 metres from others in public spaces Cover your mouth and nose properly with a tissue paper when sneezing and/or coughing. Dispose of the tissue properly immediately after use. You may also cough into your elbow if a tissue is not available Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness Stay home if you feel unwell until you recover. Do not mingle with others or congregate Avoid large gatherings of more than 50 persons and gatherings where physical distancing measures are not put in place ABOUT CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) COVID-19 appears to cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms like fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing. There is no specific cure yet for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials to test various potential antivirals. Current management of cases aims to relieve the symptoms while the body’s immune system fights the illness.

There is no scientific evidence that these tags can protect individuals from getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). NCDC’s advice is that anyone that chooses to wear these tags, should continue to adhere to the other non-pharmaceutical interventions, which we know reduces the risk of transmission of the virus. On the other hand, there is evidence that non-pharmaceutical measures such as physical distancing (avoiding crowded places), use of face masks in public settings, frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene can reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. These body tags are touted as air disinfectant with ability to inactivate any germ within the surrounding of the wearer over a long period of time. We have found no evidence to support the claim that “Air doctor” offers any benefit to the wearer. The active ingredients which are often advertised as chlorine dioxide and sodium chlorite, do not exist in the environment for a long time. Those who wear these body tags often do so as a substitute for facemasks and other recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions. This is unsafe and can contribute to the spread of COVID-19. In view of the above, NCDC offers the following guidance to members of the public: There is no scientific evidence that disinfectant tags often known as ‘Air Doctor’ can protect people against COVID-19 The composition and concentration of the active ingredients in ‘Air Doctor’ is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 which is the virus that causes COVID-19 Chlorine dioxide and its products, which are contained in such tags, can lead to serious health effects, especially in children Effective and evidence-based preventive measures against COVID-19 are: regular hand washing with soap under running water or use of alcohol-based hand rubs (hand sanitizer), physical distancing of at least 2 metres, wearing of face mask when in public, routine cleaning and disinfection of surfaces at homes and public places and ensuring cross ventilation in indoor settings The NCDC will continue to provide evidence-based guidelines on COVID-19 prevention and control. We urge the public to adhere to science-based preventive measures as recommended by public health authorities such as the NCDC, State or Federal Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation.

These seroprevalence surveys, which will be carried out in Gombe, Enugu, Nasarawa and Lagos States will provide the best evidence yet, on the extent of COVID-19 infection in Nigeria. Seroprevalence surveys are used to identify the occurrence of disease in a population by estimating the presence of antibodies in individuals who have had the disease. This is done by testing blood samples in randomly selected households in selected states. For Nigeria’s COVID-19 seroprevalence survey, household members will answer a brief questionnaire, be tested for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, as well as for acute COVID-19, if they consent. In addition to this, study participants will also have a rapid malaria test and receive treatment if the test is positive. This is the first set of household surveys to be conducted for COVID-19 in Nigeria and as part of ongoing public health research activities. The surveys will increase the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission patterns, the burden of infection in the population, and the age groups most affected. This information will help inform COVID-19 response decisions by the Government of Nigeria and partners as part of measures towards ending the pandemic. The surveys will also estimate the proportion of people who have COVID-19 but are not showing any symptoms i.e. asymptomatic. Through this, the country can identify risk factors for infection and measure the transmission of COVID-19 within households. By administering rapid malaria tests, the surveys will also assess malaria infections and their possible relationship to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results from these surveys will inform the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) and the University College London (supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) are supporting NCDC and NIMR in implementing these surveys. The US CDC’s implementing partner, the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), will also support the State Ministries of Health with implementation. The surveys will be conducted between September and November, and preliminary results are expected to be released by December 2020. The Federal Ministry of Health, its agencies NCDC and NIMR as well as the PTF-COVID-19 remain committed to strengthening Nigeria’s response to COVID-19 and controlling the outbreak.

In addition to the unfortunate displacement of people and their means of livelihood, flooding also leads to an increased risk of water-borne diseases like cholera and typhoid fever following flooding events. There is also an increase in the breeding of disease vectors such as mosquitoes that can spread diseases like malaria and yellow fever. This year, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has warned that flooding may affect 275 Local Government Areas in 28 States of the country. Flooding can result in the contamination of the water we use in our homes for drinking and domestic purposes. Nigeria is currently responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with cases in all states of the country. Given the risk of flooding, it is very important that all Nigerians take precaution to prevent the occurrence of other infectious disease outbreaks. To reduce the risk of spread of infectious diseases associated with flooding, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises that the following precautionary measures should be taken: Ensure that water is boiled, filtered and properly stored in a clean and safe container before drinking Ensure that all water storage basins are well covered when not in use Ensure proper disposal of waste, clearing of sewage and standing pools of water Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping Wash your hands frequently with soap under clean running water especially before preparing food or eating Avoid mosquito bites by ensuring consistent use of an insecticide-treated net In case of a flood, do not drink flood water or use it for daily household activity Discard all medicines, food and water contaminated by flood water If you experience sudden fever or frequent stooling, please visit a health care facility immediately Health workers should observe universal care precautions at all time Remember that the COVID-19 outbreak is not over. Continue to adhere to all recommended public health measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread such as wearing of face mask in public spaces, maintaining physical distancing and frequent cleaning of surfaces. The NCDC remains committed to ensuring that Nigerians are protected from the threat and occurrence of infectious disease outbreaks.

The establishment of the treatment centre and the laboratory is the result of the strong collaboration between the Federal and State Governments. This was commissioned on the 5th of February 2021 by the Honourable Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora. A handover was done to the State Ministry of Health and FMC Jalingo, which are expected to provide leadership and coordination for the use of these resources. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, several states in Nigeria had limited capacity for the management and detection of infectious diseases. In response to this, NCDC has been supporting states in establishing treatment centres and molecular laboratories. In the last eight months, four IDCC have been commissioned across states. Handing over the newly built treatment centre to FMC Jalingo, Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora, Honourable Minister of State for Health, commended the efforts of NCDC and the management of FMC Jalingo for their determination to see these projects to fruition. “I must start by thanking Mr. President for his commitment. At the onset of the pandemic, Nigeria had just four molecular laboratories to test for the virus, we now have almost 120 laboratories across the government and private facilities. COVID-19 is not sparing. It has devastated the lives and livelihood of so many. We are building these structures so that we are better prepared for future outbreaks and the next pandemic” As the country’s national public health institute, NCDC has supported states in their preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks. This includes supporting the establishment of diagnostic capacity, public health emergency operations centres, as well as training of health workers and rapid responders across states. In the last 11 months NCDC has supported each of the 36 states to activate testing capacity for COVID-19, further strengthening the resilience of our health system. The Chairman of the FMC Management Board, Barr Okey Ezea, assured the State Government of the Centre’s commitment to deliver quality health care to the citizens of Taraba. “Having an Isolation and Infectious Diseases Treatment Centre within this hospital had for a long time been our dream. The dream is now a reality. The coming of these facilities is well timed and will go a long way in the effective management and treatment of infectious disease cases in the state during epidemics, such as Lassa fever and COVID-19.” In his remarks, the NCDC Director General, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu said: “We are committed to building functional and sustainable structures that will strengthen our national health security, now and for the future. This pandemic has challenged us greatly but has also provided us clarity on what we need to do to secure our future. History will not judge us kindly if we fail to act and act appropriately.” About the NCDC The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is the country’s national public health institute, with the mandate to lead the preparedness, detection and response to infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies.

In addition, no attempt was made to contact the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on this matter before the newspaper went to press. This article is an unfortunate misrepresentation of efforts by Government Ministries and Agencies, to enable safe travel in the context of a pandemic affecting every country in the world. The Nigeria International Travel Portal (NITP) was launched by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF-COVID-19) with support from the Coalition Against COVID (CA-COVID). The aim of this platform is to ensure safe travel in the context of COVID-19, and to reduce the risk of a spike in COVID-19 cases as international flights resume. The NITP is currently hosted on the web portal of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and co-managed with Port Health Services of the Federal Ministry of Health and other government institutions within PTF-COVID-19. The decision to make repeat tests mandatory in Nigeria was based on a review of data by NCDC and PTF-COVID-19. The goal was to find the right balance between protecting Nigeria from more infections, while supporting the restart of international travel. From May till August 2020, evacuation and emergency flights were allowed into the country following an initial restriction on international flights. Of the number of people who returned to Nigeria, 5% tested positive within 14 days of arrival in Nigeria. In addition, several people flouted self-isolation guidance on return. Based on this data and the current capacity in Nigeria, it was decided that all travellers to Nigeria must be tested after seven days of return to the country. This was to enable early detection and to reduce the risk of further transmission of the disease. The NCDC has activated several public health laboratories for COVID-19 in Nigeria as at the 14th of September 2020. These laboratories are for public health purposes and therefore provide testing free of charge to the public. To ensure that the public health response is not affected by personal requests and needs, all travel-related testing can only be carried out in private laboratories. This is similar to current practice in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, United Arab Emirates and others. The private laboratories that provide testing for COVID-19 are commercial entities, independent of the Government of Nigeria. The PTF-COVID-19 has ensured that the prices indicated by these laboratories are as subsidised as possible. All payment received on the travel platform are sent directly to the laboratories where the passenger has chosen to be tested, chosen from a list of private laboratories approved for testing COVID-19 in Nigeria. No payment is received by NCDC for any purpose, whatsoever. We advise that passengers should not make payments outside of the official platform. The NCDC COVID-19 microsite has a list of frequently asked questions and answers, for passengers who may be facing challenges with the travel portal. It is important to emphasise that public health laboratories in the NCDC network do not provide testing services to individuals for travel-related purposes. The public health laboratories provide testing free-of-charge as part of the national response. Therefore, travellers are strongly advised to only access accredited private laboratories. A list of accredited private laboratories can be found via www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and PTF-COVID-19 remains committed to strengthening Nigeria’s response to COVID-19, and controlling this outbreak. We urge the public to remain aware of the risks of COVID-19 and to adhere to the preventive measures advised by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Federal Ministry of Health.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/322/statement-on-variants-of-sars-cov-2-in-nigeria", "title": "Statement on Variants of SARS-COV-2 in Nigeria", "body": "19th February, 2021| STATEMENT ON VARIANTS OF SARS-COV-2 IN NIGERIA Given recent press reports on new variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Nigeria, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control is making the following clarifications. All viruses naturally mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since SARS-CoV-2 was first identified, thousands of mutations have arisen and will continue to do so, allowing new strain lineages of the virus to evolve. The vast majority of mutations will have little impact. But every once in a while, a virus mutates in a way that helps it survive and reproduce better than its progenitors. Viruses carrying these mutations can then increase in frequency due to natural selection. When mutant viruses have some advantage, they are referred to as “variants of concern”. Advantage to the virus conferred by these mutations, which lead to the classification of “new variants” into “variants of concern”, can manifest in the following ways: a.faster or more efficient transmission b.increase risk of severe disease or death c.escape immunity from past infection d.escape immunity from vaccination, or e.evade detection by existing tests Scientists use a process called genomic surveillance to monitor how viruses change, including SARS-CoV-2. Genomic surveillance requires the viral genetic code of viruses to be sequenced. Scientists also study how these changes affect the characteristics of the virus and use this information to predict how new variants might impact health. In December 2020, the world’s attention was drawn to a new variant, B 1.1.7, first discovered in the UK that was shown to be more transmissible. This B 1.1.7 variant is now the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in the UK and has been documented in most countries that are implementing genomic surveillance. Other variants of concern identified in different parts of the world include the B 1.351 first identified in South Africa, where it is now dominant and the P.1 which was first identified in four travellers from Brazil. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged independently across the world, and this is likely to continue. Because only a fraction of viruses from people with COVID-19 can be sequenced, by the time a variant is detected, it is highly likely to be widespread. New variants are especially likely to be undetected when sequencing capacity is very low, as it is in most parts of the world. Indeed the countries initially reporting variants of concern are those with greater genomic surveillance capacity. More variants are likely to emerge, especially in areas of high transmission, and selected by vaccination, particularly if coverage remains suboptimal over time. IMPORTANCE OF GENOMIC SURVEILLANCE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IN NIGERIA It is critically important for Nigeria to develop its capacity for genomic surveillance to support the public health response. Routine analysis of the genomic sequence data will enable the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and its public health partners to identify variant viruses for further characterisation and investigate transmission, severity, immune escape and other facets that can dictate the impact and trajectory of the pandemic. There are three institutions with sequencing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. These are NCDC, the Nigeria Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) and the Africa Centre for Excellence in Genomics (ACEGID). ACEGID has the most advanced capacity and is also a reference laboratory for the joint World Health Organization (WHO) and Africa Centres for Disease Control COVID-19 Genome Sequencing Laboratory Network. Collaboration among these three institutions led to the first SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences reported from Africa. The University of Ibadan in collaboration with the Northwestern University in the USA has also conducted some sequencing in Nigeria. So far, about 400 sequences from Nigeria have been deposited in global databases including GISAID, mostly by ACEGID. CIRCULATING VARIANTS IN NIGERIA As at February 14 2021, there are about 55 different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 known to be circulating in Nigeria and they are changing rapidly. The diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains indicate multiple introductions of the virus into Nigeria from different parts of the world and adds to evidence of community transmission in different states of Nigeria. The B 1.1.7 Variant of Concern A total of 29 cases with the B.1.1.7 variant strain, which was first described in the UK and shown to be linked to increase in transmissibility, have so far been detected in Nigeria. These strains were detected from cases in Lagos, FCT, Osun, Oyo, and Kwara and Edo States. All samples with the B.1.1.7 variant strain were collected from patients between November and January 2021. New B.1.525 variant On the 11th of February, some recent SARS-CoV-2 genomes were seen to have distinct mutations and characterised as a new variant B.1.525. As at the 17th of February, these have been reported from United Kingdom (44), Denmark (35), Nigeria (30), United States of America (12), Canada (5), France (5), Ghana (4), Australia (2), Jordan (2), Singapore (1), Finland (1), Belgium (1) and Spain (1). The first detected B.1.525 case in Nigeria was in a sample collected on the 23rd of November from a patient in Lagos State. So far, this has been detected among cases in five states in Nigeria. B.1.525 cases have also been reported in other countries in travelers from Nigeria. Currently there is no evidence to indicate that in Nigeria. Therefore B.1.525 is a new strain, but not yet a variant of concern and further analysis is ongoing. NEXT STEPS 1.In the short term, a random selection of viruses will be collected and sent to ACEGID for sequencing weekly. This will be coordinated by the NCDC National Reference Laboratory. 2.An Implementation Group for SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing in Nigeria has been constituted to pull together a coordinated response to drive genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. The objectives of this group is to: a.Ensure a coordinated response to identify variants of concern in Nigeria b.Provide a platform for sharing of specimens and access to sequence information c.Agree and standardise practice for the analysis of genomic data d.Provide a platform to study the impact of variants of concern on transmission, disease severity, vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics e.Ensure strong communications to maintain public confidence f.Inform national COVID19 response strategies g.Provide advice on the establishment of genomic surveillance for pathogens of interest in Nigeria 3.A concerted effort will be made in building up genomic surveillance in Nigeria. PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE One way to prevent viruses from mutating is to prevent their transmission. This means that we must continue to #TakeResponsibility as members of the public. The public health measures to control this virus is the same, irrespective the variant. Please continue to avoid close contact with others, wash your hands regularly using soap and running water, wear a mask properly, keep a distance of at least two metres from others.", "date_published": "Friday, February 19, 2021", "date_scraped": "website scraped at 2021-11-03 15:20:57"}

This is part of the agency’s support to strengthen states’ capacity to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. The fully equipped treatment centre was commissioned by the Honourable Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora, on the 16th of June 2021. The centre was also officially handed over to the management of FMC Katsina and the State Government. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, NCDC has been supporting all states across Nigeria in responding to the current pandemic and in strengthening preparedness for future outbreaks. The support from NCDC includes the establishment of public health laboratories, public health emergency operations centres and treatment centres. The treatment centre in Katsina is the fifth to be commissioned in less than one year, with 11 others at various stages of development. At the commissioning of the treatment centre, the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu said, “At NCDC, we recognise the critical importance of strengthening health security at state level. The success of our work depends on strong capacity at the sub-national level. We will continue supporting all states to ensure that we have the infrastructure and resources we need to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks.” During the handover, the Honourable Minister of State for Health represented by the Chief Medical Director of the Federal Medical Centre, Gusau said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the foundations of our health, economic and social stability. However, it has also led to mammoth efforts such as the establishment of this treatment centre. By building a standard centre where infectious disease treatment can be provided, we are bringing care closer to the people, and strengthening our capacity for future outbreaks”. Nigeria has been responding to the COVID-19 pandemic for 16 months, with over 160,000 cases and 2,117 deaths recorded. Since then, investments have been made in strengthening health security across states. In addition to the establishment of infectious disease treatment centres, molecular laboratories and PHEOCs, NCDC has led the training of over 10,000 health workers on infection prevention control, completed the digitalisation of the country’s infectious disease surveillance system, provided vehicles for outbreak investigation across states, ensured regular supplies of treatment and testing supplies amongst other activities. With the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Health and support of partners, NCDC remains committed to providing support to states, and strengthening sub-national health security capacity in Nigeria.

Conducted between September and October 2020, the surveys were designed to improve the estimate of the burden of COVID-19 infection in the country and provide a more detailed estimate of the extent of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus – the virus that causes COVID-19. Blood samples were collected from over 10,000 individuals residing in a representative sample of households in the four states. The blood samples were then tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies applying locally validated laboratory tests. Individuals who provided blood samples also answered a brief questionnaire that enabled the study team to characterise factors related to positivity and identify which population groups were most affected. Survey findings released today revealed that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 23% in Lagos and Enugu States, 19% in Nasarawa State, and 9% in Gombe State. This means that as many as 1 in 5 individuals in Lagos, Enugu and Nasarawa State would have ever been infected with SARS-CoV-2. In Gombe, the proportion is about 1 in 10. These rates of infection are higher than those reported through the national surveillance system and reveal that the spread of infection in the states surveyed is wider than is obvious from surveillance activities. This is not surprising for COVID-19, given that a majority of those infected do not have any symptoms. Results of the survey further showed higher rates of infection among: 1) males than females (for example, 10% vs. 7% in Gombe and 21% vs. 17% in Nasarawa); 2) urban compared to rural and residents (for example, 28% vs. 18% in Enugu and 23% vs. 19% in Lagos); and persons aged 18-64 years. There were also variations across the local government areas (LGA) within the four states. The survey team noted that these observations are in tandem with what had been reported by the NCDC based on the national surveillance system. In interpreting the results, the survey team noted that “SARS-CoV-2 emerged only one year ago and antibody response according to severity of infection and the duration of antibody persistence are not yet completely understood”. Given the high proportion of asymptomatic cases in Nigeria, the true seroprevalence of ever having infection may be underestimated in the survey if individuals infected early in the outbreak no longer had sufficient antibodies for detection when the survey was conducted. The results from the survey show that a significant proportion of people in Nigeria are still at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore, COVID-19. It is very important that Nigerians continue to adhere to public health and social measures including regular handwashing, proper use of face masks and physical distancing. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the University College London (supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the respective State Ministries of Health supported implementation of the survey. The survey is being expanded to more states with a priority to capture information from States in the North-West and South-South geopolitical zones which were not included in the initial round of surveys. The Federal Ministry of Health, its agencies NCDC and NIMR as well as the PTF-COVID-19 remain committed to strengthening Nigeria’s response to COVID-19 and controlling the outbreak.

This was the first reported case in Sub-Saharan Africa. With over 150,000 cases reported since then, Nigeria’s response has been led by science and driven by the power of coordination, collaboration and solidarity across federal and state governments, partners, private sector and citizens. Prior to the confirmation of the first case in Nigeria, NCDC with support from its partners, began preparedness activities. The NCDC began working with states and hospitals to map out and establish isolation and treatment centres for managing COVID-19 cases. In addition to this, NCDC began training health workers across all states on case management, infection prevention control (IPC), surveillance, risk communication and other areas of epidemic preparedness and response. The agency also began to preposition medical supplies such as personal protective equipment to all states. Importantly, NCDC developed preparedness guidelines and plans that incorporated an all-inclusive ‘One Health’ approach. In the last one year, NCDC has been working under the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 (PTF-COVID-19) chaired by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha. This has enabled a multi-sectoral response to the pandemic, which has affected multiple facets of Nigeria’s economy. The NCDC has led Nigeria’s public health response to the pandemic. This includes establishing and scaling up capacity for COVID-19 testing, surveillance activities, developing public health guidelines, as well as providing technical support to states. The pandemic also provided the opportunity to rapidly scale up Nigeria’s public health infrastructure. One of these is with the establishment of more than 70 public health laboratories across the country; with at least one public health laboratory for COVID-19 testing in each state. To mark one year since the first case was reported in Nigeria, the NCDC Director General emphasised the need for continued solidarity and adherence to public health and social measures in the country: “In 2020, our country truly united in solidarity against the virus. The impact of this has been obvious from small personal gestures such as sharing foodstuff, to collaboration on research and innovation – to regional and pan-African collaboration. Despite the best efforts of government, it will take time to vaccinate everyone against COVID-19. We must keep adhering to the public health and social measures that keep each and all of us safe. This means physical distancing, wearing face masks, practicing hand and respiratory hygiene and avoiding crowded indoor places.” The recent report of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo is a reminder that outbreaks will continue to emerge. This emphasises the need for continued investment in health security at national and state level. We are grateful to health workers across the country including State Public Health Teams, for their hard work, commitment and dedication in the fight against COVID-19. We also thank our partners for their support. Finally, we thank the Federal and State Government for their leadership and investment in health security. Unfortunately, during this pandemic, many have lost their loved ones and means of livelihood. The economy has equally been affected. However, we must remember our resilience and strength as a country. We cannot afford to give up now and must continue to Take Responsibility – whether as individuals, organisations, or government. As our sister agency, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) prepares to lead the roll out of COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria, NCDC will work in solidarity with them to ensure a successful campaign. As the country’s public health institute, our focus remains to contribute to stronger health systems, to serve Nigerians into the future.

The purpose of the day is to mobilise citizens around the world on the campaign which was launched in 2009 - ‘SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands’. This campaign aims to maintain the promotion, visibility and sustainability of hand hygiene in health care settings around the world. Led by global advocacy efforts, the campaign now supports a social movement that helps to keep patients and health workers safe. Since 2019, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) through the National Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) programme has led the country’s efforts to make hand hygiene day activities a major national event in order to raise the consciousness of Nigerians on these efforts, and their role in saving lives. This year, the global Hand Hygiene Day theme is “Achieving hand hygiene at the point of care”, and the slogan is “Seconds save lives – clean your hands!” The COVID 19 pandemic has further exposed the risk of care-associated infections in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in patients admitted to intensive care units and in neonates. This is a major public health problem in Nigeria and has a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life. The national sub-theme for Nigeria this year is “One Nation, One Plan: Turn Nigeria Orange!”. This recognises the efforts that have been made since the launch of the ‘Orange Network’ in 2019. The Orange Network is a network of dedicated tertiary health facilities in Nigeria supported by NCDC, through the ‘Orange Project’ to become centers of excellence in infection prevention and control. NCDC recognises that the safety of health workers has to be at the forefront of Nigeria’s response strategy to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases. In line with activities to mark the 2021 World Hand Hygiene Day, the NCDC in collaboration with the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Jabi organised a lecture on the importance of hand hygiene in health care settings. Together with its committed partners, Infection Control Africa Network, Nigeria Society for Infection Control, Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh Health Trust (DRASA), Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others we ask that everyone takes action to promote hand hygiene. Some suggestions on how this can be done are as follows: •Health care workers: Now more than ever - clean your hands at the point of care! •IPC practitioners: Be a champion and mentor colleagues on clean hands at the point of care. •Facility managers: Ensure hand hygiene supplies are available at every point of care. •Policymakers: Invest now to ensure hand hygiene for all. •Patients and families: Wash your hands regularly, clean hands save lives. •Vaccinators: Clean your hands with every vaccine. •Everyone: Make washing your hands a regular habit - it protects us all! In collaboration with relevant government institutions and our partners, NCDC continues to support health care workers to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases while administering health care in Nigeria. Now, more than ever before, good hand hygiene must be part of all aspects of health care delivery.

The Federal Government of Nigeria and its partners recognise the need for ensuring continuity of health services, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In recognition of the risks health workers face in providing care to patients, these PPE are being provided to ensure that they are properly protected in the line of duty. As part of Nigeria’s COVID-19 response, the Federal Ministry of Health continues to prioritise infection prevention and control (IPC) of healthcare workers through training, provision of information materials and protective equipment. The PPE provided to health workers in PHCs are to ensure that they have the required resources to protect themselves and their patients from the risk of spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The items being distributed include thousands of goggles, masks, gloves, gowns, boots, waste bins, hand sanitizers, chlorine, and other commodities. These will be distributed to selected PHCs across all 774 local government areas in Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria remains grateful to its partners, especially Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF for the collaboration in ensuring the protection of health workers. The Federal Ministry of Health through its agencies remains committed to ensuring the health and safety of all Nigerians. As the NPHCDA continues to scale up Nigeria’s COVID-19 vaccination coverage, health workers are reminded of the need to practice universal care precautions at all times. Additionally, we urge members of the public to adhere to COVID-19 measures including wearing of face masks properly – covering nose and mouth, regular handwashing, avoiding large crowds, practicing physical distancing of at least two (2) metres and getting vaccinated, if eligible. About NPHCDA The NPHCDA, was established in 1992, and merged with the National Programme on Immunization (NPI) in 2007. It is the domestic development agency for Primary health care in Nigeria. Between 1986 and 1992, remarkable and innovative progress was made in the development of Primary Health Care, focusing on the Local Government Areas (LGAs), resulting in Nigeria being placed in the front rank of countries in the world that have advanced the process of equitably improving the health and quality of life of its people through primary healthcare.

The cases and deaths were reported in the N'zerekore region of the country. The cases were detected among seven people who attended the burial of a nurse on the 1st of February 2021. Following the declaration of the outbreak, the Guinean government has initiated response activities. The World Health Organization (WHO), Africa Centres for Disease Control (ACDC) and West African Health Organisation (WAHO) have announced that they are supporting the country’s response activities. The Government of Guinea has begun processes to access the global stockpile of vaccines for EVD, from the Vaccine International Coordinating Group (ICG). The NCDC has an existing multisectoral National Emerging Viral Haemorrhagic Diseases Working Group (EVHDWG). This group coordinates preparedness efforts for EVD and other emerging viral haemorrhagic diseases. The EVHDWG has carried out a risk assessment on the possibility of transmission of the virus to Nigeria. Given the proximity of Guinea to Nigeria and other West African countries as well as other indicators, Nigeria has been placed at moderate risk of an EVD outbreak. The outputs from this risk assessment are being used to initiate preparedness activities in-country. Several measures have been put in place to prevent and mitigate the impact of a potential EVD outbreak in Nigeria. A National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) operating from NCDC’s Incident Coordination Centre (ICC) is on alert mode. We have a team of first responders on standby, ready to be deployed within 24 hours in the event of an EVD outbreak in Nigeria. We have also established testing capacity for EVD at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory. The NCDC will continue working with states to strengthen preparedness activities across the country. The Port Health Services of the Federal Ministry of Health has scaled up screening at points of entry. The NCDC will also scale up risk communications and other activities. The Ebola virus can be transmitted via direct contact with bodily fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from EVD. The virus can enter the body stream through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. This can also be spread through contact with objects contaminated by infected persons as well as direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected fruit bats or primates. To prevent the spread of Ebola, NCDC advises members of the public to adhere to the following precautions: •Wash your hands frequently using soap and water – use hand sanitisers when soap and water is not readily available. •Avoid direct handling of dead wild animals. •Avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection with an unknown diagnosis. •Make sure fruits and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them. •Health care workers are advised to ensure universal precautions at all times. This includes the use of personal protective equipment always when handling patients. In January 2021, the ICG announced the establishment of a vaccine stockpile for EVD. This stockpile is accessible to countries, in the event of outbreaks. The NCDC will work with the National Primary Health Care Development Agency to develop a clear plan for accessing the EVD vaccine stockpile, as needed. The NCDC will continue to monitor the situation and initiate preparedness activities across the country. We are in close contact with WHO, ACDC and WAHO for cross-border coordination. We urge members of the public to remain aware of the risks and adhere to all safety measures. The NCDC remains fully committed to protecting the health of all Nigerians from infectious disease threats.

Findings from the project will provide scientific evidence to inform public health action for Nigeria’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Data4COVID19 Africa Challenge is a data challenge hosted by l’Agence française de développement (AFD), Expertise France, and The GovLab for projects that use data to address COVID-19 and its consequences across Africa. Following a call for innovative proposals made between December 15, 2020, and February 5, 2021, NCDC and CMUL emerged one of seven awardees to represent Nigeria in the challenge. The Nigerian project is titled ‘Understanding facilitators and barriers to compliance with non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 preventive measures in Nigeria’. The study was aimed at analysing existing conventional and non-conventional data on COVID-19 to understand the social, economic, and political factors that influence knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among Nigerians, and how these knowledge and perceptions shape population behaviour and response to COVID-19 safety protocols. The study utilised non-traditional datasets from six distinct online and telephone-based surveys that were conducted during different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. Participants in 5 out of 6 datasets were randomly selected across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Quantitative and qualitative data were triangulated for in-depth analysis and results computed. Some key findings from the study suggest overall lower perception of risk of COVID-19 in the second wave compared to the first and this was associated with increased risky behaviour. Risk perception was lowest in the southern parts of the country compared to the north during both waves with the southwest geopolitical zone having the lowest perception of risk for COVID-19. Gender, marital status, educational status, employment status and geopolitical zone of residence are factors that influenced perception of risk of COVID-19 in Nigeria during the first and second waves. In examining challenges that Nigerians faced during the lockdown, the study revealed that most Nigerians are likely to run out of food, money and medical prescriptions if a lockdown exceeds seven days. The importance of public trust as a driver of compliance to COVID-19 preventive measures was also highlighted by the study. See link to the lay report for more information on the study findings – https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/media/files/Approved_Lay_Report.pdf. Over eighteen months into the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have had to make tough decisions to sustain the COVID-19 response. The Federal Government of Nigeria have continued to institute measures to ensure a balance between preserving lives and livelihoods while addressing the socio-economic disruptions caused by the outbreak. In addition to presenting the study results, the dissemination meeting provided an opportunity for critical stakeholders to discuss how the important findings can enable relevant authorities navigate the COVID-19 response. Given NCDC’s role as Nigeria’s National Public Health Institute, we remain committed to utilising recommendations from the project to improve the COVID-19 response and strengthen health security for the future. This includes strengthening risk communication and community engagement across the states of the country by leveraging trusted voices; engaging in activities that will improve public trust which in turn could improve compliance to public health and social measures.

Since the beginning of the year, 10,833 suspected cholera cases have been reported with 112 confirmed cases and 289 deaths in 2021. In the last one month, an increasing number of cholera cases has been reported across states. The most affected states are Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Zamfara, Bayelsa and Kaduna. Given the risk of large outbreaks across states, NCDC has activated an EOC. The EOC is co-led with the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources, given the link between cholera and water, sanitation and hygiene. The National EOC has been supporting states to ensure a coordinated, rapid and effective response to the ongoing outbreak. This includes the deployment of National Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to support the response at state level, provision of medical and laboratory supplies, scale up of risk communications amongst other activities. Additionally, the resources that have been developed as part of Nigeria’s COVID-19 response are being used to strengthen the response to the cholera outbreak. This includes the digitalisation of the national surveillance system, establishment of laboratories and treatment centres, training of health workers among others. Cholera is a preventable and treatable epidemic -prone disease which is transmitted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. The number of cholera cases tends to increase with the onset of the rainy season. The risk of death from cholera is higher, when treatment is delayed. It is very important to visit a health facility if you have symptoms such as watery diarrhea and vomiting. The NCDC urges members of the public to be aware of the risk of the disease and adhere to the following precautionary measures to ensure safety; Boil and store water in a clean and safe container before drinking. Prepare, cook and store food safely. Wash hands frequently with soap under clean running water to prevent infectious diseases including cholera. This is especially important after defecation and before handling food or eating. Avoid open defecation and indiscriminate refuse dumping which contribute to the spread of cholera. Visit a health facility immediately if you have symptoms such as watery diarrhoea. Healthcare workers should have a high index of suspicion for cholera, and maintain universal care precautions at all times. The NCDC continues to advocate for improved access to clean water, proper sanitation and hygiene. This is a critical measure to prevent cholera cases and outbreaks. We urge State Governments to continue to provide access to clean water for citizens. More information on cholera, as well as the latest situation report can be accessed via – ncdc.gov.ng.

The Data4COVID19 Africa Challenge is a data challenge hosted by I’Agence francaise de development (AFD), Expertise France, and The GovLab; as part of efforts to better understand and respond to the vast range of issues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences across Africa through innovative use of data. In response to the call for innovative proposals made between December 15, 2020, and February 5, 2021; 83 proposals covering 22 countries were received out of which Nigeria represented by the NCDC in partnership with CMUL emerged as one of seven awardees. A critical aspect of the response to public health emergencies is the need to provide accurate data and real time information to decision makers and the public. This has been evident in Nigeria’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where data is used to understand transmission patterns of virus, anticipate demand on our health services, manage the national supply chain as well as inform risk communication strategies. In Nigeria, the Data4COVID19 Africa Challenge is aimed at analysing existing data on COVID-19 to understand the social, economic, and political factors that influence knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among Nigerians. The project will also inform how these knowledge and perception shape population behavior, policy and response to COVID-19 safety protocols. The Nigerian project is titled “Understanding facilitators and barriers to compliance with non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 preventive measures in Nigeria”. The aim of the meeting is to introduce the project to critical stakeholders and give them the opportunity to share their insights and concerns about COVID-19 that can be addressed through the project’s objectives. In addition to providing African researchers with resources to implement data driven projects in response to COVID-19, the project presents an opportunity to better understand the unexpectedly moderate COVID-19 situation in the region and share lessons to strengthen global pandemic preparedness. Our focus as Nigeria’s National Public Health Institute is to sustain the national response to COVID-19 to keep our cases low. We remain committed to building on lessons learnt to move beyond being recipients to active participants in the science and innovation of global preparedness and response to infectious disease threats.

{"link": "https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/333/confirmed-case-of-delta-variant-detected-in-nigeria", "title": "Confirmed Case of Delta Variant Detected in Nigeria", "body": "08 July 2021 | Abuja – Confirmed Case of Delta Variant Detected in Nigeria The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2. The variant was detected in a traveler to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travelers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja. The Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90 countries and is expected to spread to more countries. The variant has also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation. There are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and therapeutics. As part of Nigeria’s COVID-19 response, NCDC has been working with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic sequencing. This is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response activities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data. Given the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly. The Government of Nigeria through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has initiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. This includes the introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern. The national travel protocol which includes compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, are in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus. It is very important that this is strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria, NCDC urges all Nigerians to ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures in place. Proven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease. Additionally, states are urged to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public. Public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population. According to the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, “Although we have seen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly important that we do not forget to be careful. The surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face. Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures, getting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms”. The recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant continue to be testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel and public restrictions.

The launch of the roadmap by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 28th of September 2021 illustrates significant commitment towards meningitis control. This is especially critical for Nigeria as meningitis remains a major public health challenge. The global road map sets out a plan to tackle the main causes of acute bacterial meningitis through three strategic goals: (i) eliminate epidemics of bacterial meningitis; (ii) reduce cases of vaccine preventable bacterial meningitis by 50% and deaths by 70%; (iii) reduce disability and improve quality of life after meningitis of any cause. Although Nigeria has implemented interventions including the introduction of the Meningitis A Conjugate vaccine in the routine immunisation schedule, the country records annual large outbreaks of meningitis. Since the 2016/2017 meningitis outbreak in Nigeria that led to over 1,160 deaths, NCDC has continued to work closely with states within the meningitis belt. With support from WHO and partners, our support is towards strengthening preparedness, detection and response to meningitis. Some of the interventions led by NCDC include the training of clinicians on case management of meningitis and lumbar puncture to increase the rate of confirmation of cases. Additionally, NCDC has coordinated the establishment and operationalisation of a network of laboratories with the capacity to confirm cerebrospinal meningitis. To enable this, NCDC continues to support human resource training, provision of medical and laboratory supplies, development and dissemination of disease guidelines among other activities. In 2021, NCDC began a pilot study in collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), World Health Organisation and University College London. This is to develop approaches that can increase diagnostic yield of confirmed meningitis and enable early detection of outbreaks. Given Nigeria’s experience with annual outbreaks of meningitis, we remain committed to contributing to global research and development. The successful implementation of the global strategy to defeat meningitis will depend on strong political commitment and a whole-of-society approach at the country, regional and global level. As the agency with the mandate to lead the prevention, detection and control to disease outbreaks, NCDC remains committed to working with states, WHO and other partners in implementing the roadmap to defeat meningitis by 2030 in Nigeria and globally. This is in close coordination with the Federal Ministry of Health, National Primary Health Care Development Agency and other government institutions. Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM) is a priority epidemic-prone disease with cases reported all year round in Nigeria. The highest burden occurs in the part of sub-Saharan Africa known as the “Meningitis Belt”. In Nigeria, the belt covers all the 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). We continue to urge the public to be aware of the danger posed by meningitis and adhere to the known preventive measures. About Meningitis In Nigeria, cerebrospinal meningitis is recorded all year round, the disease has predilection for dry season with peak between January and May. It is characterised by acute severe infection of the central nervous system causing inflammation of the meninges with associated morbidity and mortality. The most common symptoms and signs are fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light), neck stiffness and altered consciousness, confusion or difficulty concentrating, seizures, sleepiness or difficulty waking. Infants may experience irritability, meningism, neck stiffness, bulging fontanelle, excess sleepiness, fast breathing, fast heart rate, poor feeding, sluggishness. Transmission is through direct person-to-person contact, including droplets from the nose and throat of infected persons. Transmission is facilitated by close and prolonged contact (such as sneezing and coughing), smoking, overcrowding, while certain climatic conditions like dry season, where winds, cold nights, and associated upper respiratory tract infections combine to damage the lining of the nasopharynx.

This is based on the high risk of spread of COVID—19 in Nigeria and the need for collective responsibility to prevent a surge in cases. Despite significant efforts, there is still ongoing transmission of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, in Nigeria and across the world. In addition to this, the Delta variant which is more transmissible than other known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, has been detected in Nigeria. This calls for increased adherence to public health and social measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is more likely to spread when people gather and do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. As we celebrate this year’s Eid-el-Kabir, we urge Nigerians to be aware of the high risk of spread of COVID-19, and adhere to the following preventive measures: 1. Limit all non-essential domestic and international travel. This is especially important for intending travellers from countries with a high number of new COVID-19 cases. If you must travel to Nigeria, please adhere to the self-isolation, testing and other travel-related protocols 2. Always wear a facemask that covers your nose and mouth when in public settings or with people outside your household 3. Maintain physical distance of at least two metres from people outside your household 4. Avoid direct contact with people such as hugging and handshaking. Avoid sharing items such as prayer mats and kettles 5. If you must gather, please do this outdoors; otherwise, ensure that the indoor venue has enough space to accommodate attendees with appropriate physical distancing, adequate ventilation, and air flow. This must be in line with the existing COVID-19 health regulations 6. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer when hands are not visibly dirty and running water is not readily available 7. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue paper, or your elbow when sneezing and/or coughing. Dispose of the tissue properly immediately after use and wash your hands. 8. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness 9. Stay at home if you feel unwell and call your state helpline for information on how to access testing. Do not mingle with others if you have symptoms such as fever, cough or sudden loss of sense of taste or smell 10. Vulnerable groups i.e. people 60 years and above and/or people with pre-existing medical conditions should avoid non-essential outings and visitors. Where possible, a friend or family member should safely deliver food or any needed supplies. See NCDC advisory for more information- https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/media/files/AdvisoryforVulnerableGroupsV2June2020.pdf While the COVID-19 vaccine confers some protection against the disease, it is important for vaccinated people to continue practicing these public health and social measures, to protect themselves and others. We appeal to religious and traditional leaders to ensure adherence to safe practices at mosques, places of worship and other venues, where religious and social gatherings occur. Finally, we urge all Nigerians to take personal and collective responsibility to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19, as we celebrate Eid-el-Kabir. We wish all Muslim faithful a Happy Sallah.

This has been exacerbated by poor access to clean water, open defecation, poor sanitation, and hygiene. Between the 1st of January and 1st of August 2021, 31,425 suspected cases of cholera, 311 confirmed cases and 816 deaths have been reported from 22 states and FCT. The affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and FCT. Following an increase in the number of cholera cases, the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated on the 22nd of June 2021. The EOC which is hosted at NCDC, includes representation from the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organization (WHO) and partners. The National Cholera EOC has led the deployment of Rapid Response Teams to support the most affected states -– Benue, Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Bauchi and Plateau States. Additionally, NCDC and its partners have provided states with commodities for case management and laboratory diagnosis, materials for risk communications, response guidelines among other support. A reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA, Bauchi State from 24th to 28th July 2021. But none of these medical interventions will solve the underlying issues leading to cholera outbreaks. Cholera is a waterborne disease, and the risk of transmission is higher when there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply. The wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use. These lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Without proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths. The long-term solution for cholera control lies in access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene. We continue to advocate to State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities. Additionally, we urge Nigerians to keep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running water. Cholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately. Nigerians are advised to visit a health facility immediately, if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. As the NCDC continues to work with partners to lead the health-sector response to cholera outbreaks, we call for an urgent improvement in access to clean water, proper sanitation and hygiene. About Cholera Cholera is a water-borne disease characterised by sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, which can lead to sudden death as a result of dehydration, if not managed on time. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Most infected people may only show mild symptoms or have no symptom at all. The time between an infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease is 2 hours to 5 days. The disease is easily treatable, if detected early. Most infected people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS), with the goal to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. The ORS solution is available as a powder that can be reconstituted in boiled or bottled water. Without rehydration, approximately half the people with cholera die. With treatment, the number of fatalities drops to less than 1 percent. Severely dehydrated people may also need intravenous fluids. People most at risk are: •People of all ages living in places with unsafe water •People living in areas with poor sanitation •People who consume potentially contaminated food or fruits without proper cooking and washing with safe water •People who do not perform hand hygiene when appropriate •Relatives who care for sick person with cholera at home •Health care workers including: •Doctors, nurses and other health workers providing direct patient care in the absence of standard precautions. To reduce the risk of cholera, the NCDC offers the following advice: •Ensure that water is boiled and stored in a clean and safe container before drinking •Practice good personal hygiene by washing your hands frequently with soap under clean running water. Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser if soap and clean water are not available •Ensure that food is well cooked before consumption. Avoid raw food such as fruits and vegetables, except you have washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself. •Avoid open defecation, indiscriminate refuse dumping and ensure proper disposal of waste and frequent clearing of sewage •If you experience sudden watery diarrhoea, please do not self-medicate, visit a health care facility immediately and take all sick persons with the signs or symptoms above to a health care facility immediately •Healthcare workers are advised to practice standard precautions at all times: i.e. wearing gloves while handling patients or providing care to an ill patient/relative.
